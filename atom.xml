In this post, we will tell you how to do Facebook video marketing.</p><h2 id="10-tips-for-Facebook-video-marketing"><a href="#10-tips-for-Facebook-video-marketing" class="headerlink" title="10 tips for Facebook video marketing"></a>10 tips for Facebook video marketing</h2><h3 id="1-Facebook-Live-video-is-a-trend"><a href="#1-Facebook-Live-video-is-a-trend" class="headerlink" title="1. Facebook Live video is a trend"></a>1. Facebook Live video is a trend</h3><p>Since last year, the average time for consuming Facebook Live videos has increased four-fold. Reports from Facebook’s research reveal that video content is consumed five times more than static content by the users.</p><p>Facebook Live has taken things to a new level. As soon as you go live on Facebook, your friends and followers&#x2F;subscribers get notifications automatically.</p><p>Facebook video marketing seems great where you can live interact with your consumers about your products&#x2F;services or a promotional event. You get feedbacks, suggestions for improvements, or outright praise from them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-live-iphone.JPG"                      alt="facebook live video"                ></p><h3 id="2-Upload-Videos-Directly-to-Facebook-rather-than-YouTube"><a href="#2-Upload-Videos-Directly-to-Facebook-rather-than-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="2. Upload Videos Directly to Facebook rather than YouTube"></a>2. Upload Videos Directly to Facebook rather than YouTube</h3><p>Though videos on YouTube usually get views but uploading directly on to Facebook would bring more viewership for your social media video.</p><p>Videos on Facebook perform better than other platforms for video sharing denotes a popular source. Apart from that compared to photo and other graphic posts, videos receive a whopping 135% higher organic search on Facebook.</p><p>Facebook marketing videos are becoming the strongest confidants of business owners nowadays due to these facts.</p><p>The default auto-play feature even makes things lot better, as people stop by to watch at least 5-6 seconds of the video while scrolling down and get hooked to it, without even searching for it.</p><p>The video view counter helps you estimate the way your viral video fared. You can understand users’ behavior to understand their needs and what can you do to bring them to you again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-facebook.JPG"                      alt="upload video to facebook"                ></p><h3 id="3-Keep-your-Facebook-video-short"><a href="#3-Keep-your-Facebook-video-short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep your Facebook video short"></a>3. Keep your Facebook video short</h3><p>Like text content, your Facebook Marketing video should also be crisp and short. Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video. Creating them in widely used language (such as English) would garner more popularity sans the cultural or geographical background of a person.</p><p>Shorter videos between 2 minutes effectively perform in comparison to longer versions. But, ensure that the gist of your message should be delivered within that time frame. Make the video so understandable and connecting, that words just add charm to it and not solely define it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-length.JPG"                      alt="facebook video short"                ></p><h3 id="4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically"><a href="#4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically" class="headerlink" title="4. Shoot Facebook video vertically"></a>4. Shoot Facebook video vertically</h3><p>A majority of Facebook users watch videos on their mobile phone or tablets. So shooting your social media video in vertical mode is pleasing to the eyes, while viewing it on a mobile. Portrait (vertically-aligned) videos have a better hit rate compared to horizontal shots. Keeping that in mind, make sure to create your new videos in a mobile friendly manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-vertical.JPG"                      alt="facebook vidoe vertical"                ></p><h3 id="5-Feature-a-Video-on-Facebook-Page"><a href="#5-Feature-a-Video-on-Facebook-Page" class="headerlink" title="5. Feature a Video on Facebook Page"></a>5. Feature a Video on Facebook Page</h3><p>Just like featured photos on the about section of your Facebook page, you can add your Facebook marketing video as a featured video. When people love your video they keep on sharing it to their near and dear ones, be it about anything.</p><p>It will make your video get popular and go viral as well in case it gets shared fast in a large number. Ensure that the video has a prominent thumbnail on your about page.</p><p>You can use it to promote an event, launch a product or service, or a teaser about some upcoming surprises. The clearer it gets on your page, the more clicks you will get from the audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feature-video-facebook.JPG"                      alt="feature video facebook"                ></p><h3 id="6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail"><a href="#6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="6. Carefully choose thumbnail"></a>6. Carefully choose thumbnail</h3><p>Well! We have just said about the thumbnail on your Facebook video. The social media video you upload on Facebook will garner more viewership with a suitable and attractive thumbnail.</p><p>When there is a weak internet connection, the videos on Facebook might not auto-play; they would display a static image there. Don’t exceed the 90 characters Ad copy limit for the thumbnail, in case your video has text on it. Try to keep it as less as you can to adhere to Facebook’s 20% text policy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="facebook thumbnail"                ></p><h3 id="7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos"><a href="#7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7.

Keeping virtual reality in mind, Facebook launched this feature to improve communication and social interaction.</p><p>With a social media video shot with Facebook 360-degree feature, your viewers will connect more with your story and the experience you are sharing. For shooting an event and taking panoramic views 360-videos serve the best result.</p><p>These videos can be rotated, paned, and can be viewed from any angle they desire. They are loved 40 percent more than the traditional videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-360-video.JPG"                      alt="facebook 360 video"                ></p><h3 id="8-Mobile-friendly"><a href="#8-Mobile-friendly" class="headerlink" title="8.

You can add a link using goo.gl or bit.ly to cut-short the link and guide them for more information about your services.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="facebook call to action"                ></p><h3 id="11-Choose-a-suitable-video-creator"><a href="#11-Choose-a-suitable-video-creator" class="headerlink" title="11.

Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method"><a href="#First-Method" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu. You will see a lot of different tabs here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Look for the Syndicate Option</strong></p><p>In the drop-down menu, look for the Syndicate tab. Under it, click on “Publish to Facebook” to transfer the video to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="search for the Syndicate tab to “Publish video on Facebook”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Set the Desired Settings</strong></p><p>A dialog box will appear where you can enter your Facebook account, set the title, adjust the description, set the publish time, and set the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Set the Desired Settings"                ></p><p>Once you are done, click on “Publish to Facebook,” and voila!</p><p>Now, your YouTube video will be uploaded on your Facebook page as a video and will play automatically as the rest of the Facebook videos do.</p><h3 id="Second-Method"><a href="#Second-Method" class="headerlink" title="Second Method"></a>Second Method</h3><p>The second method of ensuring the autoplay feature works with your videos is to upload them directly from your computer. You can also download videos from YouTube using third-party services and then upload them on Facebook.</p><p>The step-by-step guide is given below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search and Open the Video</strong></p><p>Go to YouTube, search for the video you want to share on Facebook, and open it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Copy the URL</strong></p><p>At the top of the page, copy the URL of the page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use Any Third-Party Service</strong></p><p>Some different third-party apps and websites help you convert and download YouTube videos. Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.</p><p>Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.</strong></p><p>Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo&#x2F;Video below the status bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Status bar"                ></p><p>Click on it, select the video you want to upload, and then post it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>You can use this particular method for uploading any video that you have on your computer.

Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method-3"><a href="#First-Method-3" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu. You will see a lot of different tabs here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Look for the Syndicate Option</strong></p><p>In the drop-down menu, look for the Syndicate tab. Under it, click on “Publish to Facebook” to transfer the video to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="search for the Syndicate tab to “Publish video on Facebook”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Set the Desired Settings</strong></p><p>A dialog box will appear where you can enter your Facebook account, set the title, adjust the description, set the publish time, and set the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Set the Desired Settings"                ></p><p>Once you are done, click on “Publish to Facebook,” and voila!</p><p>Now, your YouTube video will be uploaded on your Facebook page as a video and will play automatically as the rest of the Facebook videos do.</p><h3 id="Second-Method-3"><a href="#Second-Method-3" class="headerlink" title="Second Method"></a>Second Method</h3><p>The second method of ensuring the autoplay feature works with your videos is to upload them directly from your computer. You can also download videos from YouTube using third-party services and then upload them on Facebook.</p><p>The step-by-step guide is given below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search and Open the Video</strong></p><p>Go to YouTube, search for the video you want to share on Facebook, and open it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Copy the URL</strong></p><p>At the top of the page, copy the URL of the page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use Any Third-Party Service</strong></p><p>Some different third-party apps and websites help you convert and download YouTube videos. Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.</p><p>Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.</strong></p><p>Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo&#x2F;Video below the status bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Status bar"                ></p><p>Click on it, select the video you want to upload, and then post it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>You can use this particular method for uploading any video that you have on your computer.

Have you ever noticed that it has a weird number as its name when you download a Facebook image? Before using this method, it is important to keep something in your mind. After using this method, you will be redirected to a profile, you don’t need to reach a profile of the person in the photo. But it might be a profile where this picture was originated. Another thing to be considered is that the profile you will reach after this reverse image search Facebook may contain limited information depending upon the profile’s privacy settings.</p><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> First of all, we have to locate the photo ID of the image. To do that, navigate to the image and right-click on it. Now select “Copy Image Address.” It will copy the link to the image. Now paste it somewhere like Word or Notepad. To see how it looks like.

But, they are unaware of the significance of Facebook SEO and what potential it has for their brand enhancement. If the SEO for your Facebook page is done right, your brand’s Google rankings would move a notch higher. This in turn will <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >attract more influencers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> organically to find you. If you are unsure about the entire process of implementing SEO for Facebook, then here is a quick peek through.</p><p> In this article, we are going to introduce you the significant aspects and ways for enhancing the Facebook SEO strategy for your brand.</p><h2 id="How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO"><a href="#How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO" class="headerlink" title="How to optimize Facebook SEO"></a>How to optimize Facebook SEO</h2><h3 id="1-Optimize-Facebook-Content"><a href="#1-Optimize-Facebook-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Facebook Content"></a>1. Optimize Facebook Content</h3><p> Speaking of SEO for Facebook page, though, it might not have a direct impact on social media content and popup results for your keyword search on Google. You need to mention the social media platform name in Google search to get the results. Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide" >optimize social media content using keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Links and public posts using those keywords will show up on the search results.</p><p> People click and engage with your content if it’s relevant to them and included in the keywords, and spend more time on your site.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-Page-URL"><a href="#2-Optimize-Page-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize Page URL"></a>2. Optimize Page URL</h3><p> For Facebook SEO, you need to have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.weebly.com/seo/url" >custom URL same as your brand name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL. Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.</p><h3 id="3-Optimize-company-profile"><a href="#3-Optimize-company-profile" class="headerlink" title="3. Optimize company profile"></a>3. Optimize company profile</h3><p> While doing SEO for Facebook page, not every brand optimizes their company profile online. But, it is crucial to optimize and encourage growth of the Facebook fan page for their brands. When you add phone numbers and address on your business page, Google gives more credibility to your page. As a result, your brand’s overall SEO will be enhanced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile.JPG"                      alt="facebook profile"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes"><a href="#4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Facebook Notes"></a>4. Optimize Facebook Notes</h3><p> Facebook Notes are utilized to create engagement and inform your fans about important business related news, current crisis or upcoming events. These Notes get indexed post search by Google for business profile only. Through them, you can add keyword rich content and improve the fan page ranks in Google and Bing. Photos as well as the title and Note contain keywords within the caption. After adding captions to your Notes, if users comment in it, then the chances to rank higher increases. If the comments too have keywords as well, the Notes gains more value, attracting engagement and tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/note-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Optimize Facebook Notes"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page"><a href="#5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page" class="headerlink" title="5. Add Backlink to your fan page"></a>5. Add Backlink to your fan page</h3><p> Facebook SEO requires inbound links to your page, in order to improvise the authoritativeness of your page as per Google for high ranking. Always <a class="link"   href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/external-facebook-fan-30204.html" >include a link to your fan page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from digital channels like blog, website, Twitter profile to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-backlink-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Add Backlink to your fan page"                ></p><h3 id="6-Post-Fresh-Content"><a href="#6-Post-Fresh-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Post Fresh Content"></a>6. Post Fresh Content</h3><p> Fresh, keyword optimized, quality content is important for social media as well as website pages for any brand. It applies to Facebook equally. Unique content helps your brand rank better, but at times you run out of content ideas. Using influencer marketing, you can add fresh content with a new tone to your content marketing drives. Guest posts, product review, and campaigns on social media takeover can help your business to a great extent. Influencers propel their followers for creating unique content for your business. Through hashtags, they might ask their followers to tag them and your brand as well in social media campaigns or share their experiences.</p><h3 id="7-Make-Business-time-Accurate"><a href="#7-Make-Business-time-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="7. Make Business time Accurate"></a>7. Make Business time Accurate</h3><p> Mentioning the business times on your Facebook page is important. In case it changes, you need to immediately update it. Moreover, new location page additions along with correct operational hours and days should be mentioned too. Facebook doesn’t have the feature to allow you customizing hours for special events or holidays, but you can use Facebook posts and advertising to meet that need.</p><h3 id="8-Optimize-featured-Image"><a href="#8-Optimize-featured-Image" class="headerlink" title="8. Optimize featured Image"></a>8. Optimize featured Image</h3><p> To do justice with SEO on your Facebook page, you need to customize your page by adding an avatar&#x2F;profile feature and utilizing the featured image section at its best. Along with photo, you can also add a video or a slideshow in the featured image&#x2F;banner section. Testimonials, team credits can be promoted in this section. Facebook emphasizes that cover photos shouldn’t be misleading, deceptive, or infringe any copyright.</p><h3 id="9-Manage-Customer-Reviews"><a href="#9-Manage-Customer-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="9. Manage Customer Reviews"></a>9. Manage Customer Reviews</h3><p> Customer interaction and engagement is vital for social media platforms and Facebook allows a great deal in this aspect. There needs to be a proper strategy for <a class="link"   href="https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/consumer-laws/customer-service/managing-customer-reviews/tips" >management of comments and reviews, ads and posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Always make sure to respond to reviews, even if they are not what you have expected. It builds trust for your brand. You have the control over enabling or disabling customer reviews.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="Manage Customer Reviews"                ></p><h3 id="10-Include-a-Call-to-Action"><a href="#10-Include-a-Call-to-Action" class="headerlink" title="10. Include a Call-to-Action"></a>10. Include a Call-to-Action</h3><p> Facebook SEO doesn’t typically bring results with regular content sharing. Having a Call-to-Action within your shared links on blogs and product pages on Facebook has more advantages. Click the link, comments, share the post are forms of call to actions here. A compelling CTA actually does the right thing for your post. Without a Call-to-Action, Facebook SEO concept is highly incomplete and hence it is the last and essential tip for you to optimize the SEO of your Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="Include a Call-to-Action"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> From the above article, we are confident that you have got the goodies you wanted to take home and implement with your Facebook brand page. With such amazing features spread across social media, it’s obvious that gathering high ranks over search engine results won’t be a problem for your brand. Make sure to adhere to the specific guidelines under each section, while implementing SEO strategies on your Facebook brand page.
