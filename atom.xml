For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook profile page and not the feed page. On your profile, scroll down a bit and click on the Music icon.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-music-track-from-facebook-profile.jpg"                      alt="delete Facebook Profile Music"                ></p><p>You can remove one song or multiple of them.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile"><a href="#Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?</h2><p>If you are someone who likes to express yourself through music, then Facebook can let you do that efficiently. This new feature rolled out a few years back. To find the add Music feature on your profile, you need to follow the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, launch your Facebook app and log in using your credentials. You will be taken to the feed page first. Once you are there, click on your profile to go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you are there on your profile, you need to scroll down a little, and you will see the Music tab.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the Music tab. Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear. You can search for the songs you like to add to your profile here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-feature.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music feature"                ></p><p>And that’s how the Music feature works on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Music makes this world better, and we agree with that. Now that Facebook allows you to add a song to your profile, feel free to express yourself better because you never know who you might inspire just by adding a relatable song to your profile, right.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Sparking-Social-Media-Stories-Facebook-Fame-Techniques"><a href="#Sparking-Social-Media-Stories-Facebook-Fame-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Sparking Social Media Stories: Facebook Fame Techniques"></a>Sparking Social Media Stories: Facebook Fame Techniques</h2><p>If you want your Facebook page to go viral, it’s not enough to just post content. You have to find the right type of content that people will share with their friends. We all know that some posts are more likely than others to get shared on social media—but what makes them so clickable? Well, there are several different types of Facebook-ready material out there in the world:</p><h2 id="Contests-and-Giveaways"><a href="#Contests-and-Giveaways" class="headerlink" title="Contests and Giveaways"></a>Contests and Giveaways</h2><p>Contests and giveaways are a great way to get people to engage with your page. While it’s important to make sure that the contest is fun, easy, and not too much work for you, you should also think about what kind of prizes would be relevant and interesting to people who visit your page.</p><p>Remember: giveaways should be something people want! A good prize will help attract more participation in the contest and create buzz around your brand.</p><p>Contest Alert from Enchanted Kingdom is the perfect Facebook contest idea to generate excitement for their upcoming events.</p><h2 id="Your-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Life Events"></a>Your Life Events</h2><p>As a business owner, you want to create a buzz on Facebook. You’ve tried posting ads and boosting posts, but that doesn’t seem to be working for you. The answer is simple: post about your life events!</p><p>You don’t have to be an attendee of someone else’s wedding or send out birth announcements every time one of your family members gives birth; however, if you have something exciting going on in your life (or even just funny stories) there are plenty of opportunities for viral content.</p><p>These types of posts can really boost the engagement on your page because they show off the human side of being a business owner—you’re not just posting about how great your services are; people get excited when they see that their favorite barista had a baby or experienced some kind of major success in life.</p><p>A great example of a life event post is when Mark Zuckerberg’s post is coming baby with Priscilla Chan. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and Priscilla Chan are going to have a baby, the reaction from the audience ranged anywhere between congratulations and excitement for their future kid. The post has since gone viral with over 1.3 reactions!</p><h2 id="Your-Company’s-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Company’s-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Company’s Life Events"></a>Your Company’s Life Events</h2><ul><li>Share milestones and achievements. This is one of the easiest ways to create a buzz on Facebook. No matter if you’re celebrating a major accomplishment or simply adding a new employee to your team, highlight it! Has some sort of contest or giveaway that encourages fans to join in on the celebration (i.e., “Like this post if you want us to throw you a party”).</li><li>Share news about your company. Stay connected with customers by sharing news and updates regarding your company, products, services, and more – especially if they are relevant to what people are talking about in their social networks at that time (i.e., Trending Topics). For example: “Want a sneak peek at our upcoming product launch? Click here.” If there’s something going on in your industry that’s creating buzz throughout social networks, be sure not only to talk about it but also show how it relates back to what makes your business special&#x2F;different from everyone else out there!</li></ul><p>Take a look at Ford’s post about their Media’s Awards Choice in the years 2020-2021. It features the Ford Ranger and Ford Mustang. It’s a great post if you’re interested in cars.</p><h2 id="Seasonal-and-Holiday-Posts"><a href="#Seasonal-and-Holiday-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Seasonal and Holiday Posts"></a>Seasonal and Holiday Posts</h2><ul><li>Use the holiday to your advantage. While you may not be able to get in on the actual celebrations, you can still use the holidays and seasonal content to your advantage. For example, if it’s Halloween time, consider posting pictures from last year’s party! People love nostalgia and will share those posts with their friends in no time.</li><li>Create a holiday giveaway or contest. Customers love free stuff! Create a competition that includes everyone; even if someone does not win anything valuable (although this is always appreciated), they will still feel appreciated for joining your page because they were given the chance at receiving something nice as well as help out their favorite business by spreading awareness about it through social media sharing of their own.</li></ul><p>Check this Mother’s Day post from Mason Cash with their mechanics of Like, Follow &amp; comment to win a Mother’s Day bundle worth over $75.</p><h2 id="Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist"><a href="#Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist" class="headerlink" title="Classic Photos with a Twist"></a>Classic Photos with a Twist</h2><p>One way to get your photo on the front page of Facebook is with a classic picture. But you can’t just post any old photo and hope for the best. You need to make sure that the image looks as good as possible, and it needs to be relevant to your business or brand.</p><p>While most people think of their feed as a place where they’ll see pictures of friends and family, there are plenty of opportunities here for businesses too—if they know what they’re doing. A good caption will also help keep your audience engaged by adding value to the photo; don’t go overboard with hashtags though, because that’s one way of making it harder for people who aren’t following you yet (or who have never heard of you) from finding this information later on down the line when they decide whether or not they want something from your store&#x2F;organization&#x2F;etcetera.”</p><p>The photo of this simple yet creative picture with 308 reactions, 55 comments, and 13 shares from Lenovo is one among many examples of a classic photo with a twist post.</p><h2 id="Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos"><a href="#Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos" class="headerlink" title="Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)"></a>Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)</h2><p>Photos of animals are the most popular content on Facebook and for good reason. They’re cute! They’re funny! And they make you feel things—maybe even happy or inspired. In other words, they’re relatable in a way that other posts aren’t.</p><p>There’s also the fact that photos of animals can be used to promote your brand in subtle ways. For example, if you have an animal-related product or business (cat food company), then including cats in your photos will attract cat lovers who might not otherwise follow you on social media.</p><p>Check out one of the amazing Subaru of America, Inc. commercials featuring one of Golden Meadows puppies, Amber, learning how to parallel park!</p><h2 id="Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring"><a href="#Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring" class="headerlink" title="Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring"></a>Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring</h2><p>The best way to get likes, comments, and shares on your Facebook page is by posting high-quality content that people will want to share with their friends. The reason why a post goes viral on Facebook is that it’s either informative or entertaining.</p><ul><li>For inspiration: Post something that motivates the reader and makes them feel good about themselves or their life situation. You can do this in many ways such as sharing quotes from famous people, funny videos or photos, etc.</li><li>For fun: Post things that make the readers laugh like funny photos, memes or cartoons&#x2F;drawings of characters from popular movies&#x2F;cartoon series like Pokemon Go! Which has become a global phenomenon!</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS:</strong> Wondershare Filmora can help you to create stunning videos that can go viral.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, anyone can create stunning videos that are sure to capture the attention of the online world.

Just below this you will be seeing the comments from your viewers.</p><p> 7. The camera can be changed with the help of the switch button on the top right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch.jpg"                      alt="switch"                ></p><p> 8.

You need to keep in mind that the maximum time limit for broadcasting on Facebook is 30 minutes.</p><p> 2. If you get trolled by other users while broadcasting or you don’t like the comments from a viewer then you can choose to block them from the broadcast. Just click on their profile pic which appears beside their comment and hit <strong>‘Block’</strong>.</p><p> 3. Before you go live on Facebook make sure that you have fast connection. Wi-fi works best for live broadcast on Facebook. If you don’t have wifi access then try using a 4G connection. Ideally you should check the speed of your net before you start broadcasting. For this you need to go to Google Play or App Store and download the Speedtest application.</p><p> 4. Once the broadcast is done the video is going to appear on your Facebook profile page and can be seen by your selected audience. However you can choose to remove the video at any time if your want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-your-social-presence-with-easy-fb-video-upload-pc-and-android-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhance Your Social Presence with Easy FB Video Upload, PC & Android for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-top-picks-of-firefox-tools-to-streamline-your-facebook-video-experience-2023/"><u>[Updated] Top Picks of Firefox Tools to Streamline Your Facebook Video Experience, 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-understanding-facebooks-video-privacy-settings/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Understanding Facebook's Video Privacy Settings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-revolutionizing-facebook-advertising-through-creative-insight/"><u>[New] Revolutionizing Facebook Advertising Through Creative Insight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-highest-watched-online-clips-list/"><u>[New] In 2024, Highest-Watched Online Clips List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/instagram-video-sharing-essentials-for-2024/"><u>Instagram Video Sharing Essentials for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/streamline-social-video-downloads-with-new-app/"><u>Streamline Social Video Downloads with New App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-extract-facebooks-most-viewed-videos-anywhere-2023-for-2024/"><u>[New] Extract Facebook's Most Viewed Videos Anywhere, 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-action-cam-reimagined-an-extensive-review-of-the-sj-cam-s6/"><u>2024 Approved  Action Cam Reimagined  An Extensive Review of the SJ-CAM S6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-samsung-galaxy-s23-tactical-edition-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-stepwise-guide-for-discovering-recent-watch-history-on-fb/"><u>In 2024, Stepwise Guide for Discovering Recent Watch History on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-home-movie-mastery-ezvid-for-mac-makes-video-creation-a-breeze/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Home Movie Mastery Ezvid for Mac Makes Video Creation a Breeze</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/essential-list-best-video-platforms-for-secure-businesses-for-2024/"><u>Essential List  Best Video Platforms for Secure Businesses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-effective-strategies-for-google-voice-call-saves/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Effective Strategies for Google Voice Call Saves</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-shortcut-knowledge-for-flawless-mac-recordings/"><u>2024 Approved  Essential Shortcut Knowledge for Flawless Mac Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-evaluating-superiority-gopros-max-and-hero-11-face-off/"><u>[New] In 2024, Evaluating Superiority  GoPro's Max and Hero 11 Face-Off</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/repair-video-tool-repair-all-your-damaged-video-files-of-y36i-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>Repair Video Tool - Repair all your damaged video files of Y36i</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

But, they are unaware of the significance of Facebook SEO and what potential it has for their brand enhancement. If the SEO for your Facebook page is done right, your brand’s Google rankings would move a notch higher. This in turn will <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >attract more influencers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> organically to find you. If you are unsure about the entire process of implementing SEO for Facebook, then here is a quick peek through.</p><p> In this article, we are going to introduce you the significant aspects and ways for enhancing the Facebook SEO strategy for your brand.</p><h2 id="How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO"><a href="#How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO" class="headerlink" title="How to optimize Facebook SEO"></a>How to optimize Facebook SEO</h2><h3 id="1-Optimize-Facebook-Content"><a href="#1-Optimize-Facebook-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Facebook Content"></a>1. Optimize Facebook Content</h3><p> Speaking of SEO for Facebook page, though, it might not have a direct impact on social media content and popup results for your keyword search on Google. You need to mention the social media platform name in Google search to get the results. Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide" >optimize social media content using keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Links and public posts using those keywords will show up on the search results.</p><p> People click and engage with your content if it’s relevant to them and included in the keywords, and spend more time on your site.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-Page-URL"><a href="#2-Optimize-Page-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize Page URL"></a>2. Optimize Page URL</h3><p> For Facebook SEO, you need to have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.weebly.com/seo/url" >custom URL same as your brand name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL. Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.</p><h3 id="3-Optimize-company-profile"><a href="#3-Optimize-company-profile" class="headerlink" title="3. Optimize company profile"></a>3. Optimize company profile</h3><p> While doing SEO for Facebook page, not every brand optimizes their company profile online. But, it is crucial to optimize and encourage growth of the Facebook fan page for their brands. When you add phone numbers and address on your business page, Google gives more credibility to your page. As a result, your brand’s overall SEO will be enhanced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile.JPG"                      alt="facebook profile"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes"><a href="#4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Facebook Notes"></a>4. Optimize Facebook Notes</h3><p> Facebook Notes are utilized to create engagement and inform your fans about important business related news, current crisis or upcoming events. These Notes get indexed post search by Google for business profile only. Through them, you can add keyword rich content and improve the fan page ranks in Google and Bing. Photos as well as the title and Note contain keywords within the caption. After adding captions to your Notes, if users comment in it, then the chances to rank higher increases. If the comments too have keywords as well, the Notes gains more value, attracting engagement and tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/note-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Optimize Facebook Notes"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page"><a href="#5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page" class="headerlink" title="5. Add Backlink to your fan page"></a>5.

Always <a class="link"   href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/external-facebook-fan-30204.html" >include a link to your fan page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from digital channels like blog, website, Twitter profile to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-backlink-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Add Backlink to your fan page"                ></p><h3 id="6-Post-Fresh-Content"><a href="#6-Post-Fresh-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Post Fresh Content"></a>6. Post Fresh Content</h3><p> Fresh, keyword optimized, quality content is important for social media as well as website pages for any brand. It applies to Facebook equally. Unique content helps your brand rank better, but at times you run out of content ideas. Using influencer marketing, you can add fresh content with a new tone to your content marketing drives. Guest posts, product review, and campaigns on social media takeover can help your business to a great extent. Influencers propel their followers for creating unique content for your business. Through hashtags, they might ask their followers to tag them and your brand as well in social media campaigns or share their experiences.</p><h3 id="7-Make-Business-time-Accurate"><a href="#7-Make-Business-time-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="7.

Optimize featured Image"></a>8. Optimize featured Image</h3><p> To do justice with SEO on your Facebook page, you need to customize your page by adding an avatar&#x2F;profile feature and utilizing the featured image section at its best. Along with photo, you can also add a video or a slideshow in the featured image&#x2F;banner section. Testimonials, team credits can be promoted in this section. Facebook emphasizes that cover photos shouldn’t be misleading, deceptive, or infringe any copyright.</p><h3 id="9-Manage-Customer-Reviews"><a href="#9-Manage-Customer-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="9. Manage Customer Reviews"></a>9. Manage Customer Reviews</h3><p> Customer interaction and engagement is vital for social media platforms and Facebook allows a great deal in this aspect. There needs to be a proper strategy for <a class="link"   href="https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/consumer-laws/customer-service/managing-customer-reviews/tips" >management of comments and reviews, ads and posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Include a Call-to-Action"></a>10. Include a Call-to-Action</h3><p> Facebook SEO doesn’t typically bring results with regular content sharing. Having a Call-to-Action within your shared links on blogs and product pages on Facebook has more advantages. Click the link, comments, share the post are forms of call to actions here. A compelling CTA actually does the right thing for your post. Without a Call-to-Action, Facebook SEO concept is highly incomplete and hence it is the last and essential tip for you to optimize the SEO of your Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="Include a Call-to-Action"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> From the above article, we are confident that you have got the goodies you wanted to take home and implement with your Facebook brand page.
