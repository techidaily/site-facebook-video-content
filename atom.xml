The grey badge verification request takes around 48 hours and the blue badge verification request needs around 3 to 45 days to receive the Facebook response.

You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/). You may also hire my digital marketing agency for the same.  * **Your Wikipedia is missing** \- In order to create a Wiki; you firstly require the high-quality press.  * **Your identity proof is not up to the mark** \- When your reason for verification request is not very compelling or the ID provided by you is blurry or inappropriate, your request may get rejected.  * **Missing Facebook Native Content** \- Facebook hates a dead page. So, it is important that your page is filled with relevant and great content for long.  * **Verification is Strict** \- Facebook only verifies the popular pages and profiles easily if you can establish your popularity. It is very strict on who they verify.</code></pre><h2 id="Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification"><a href="#Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification"></a>Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification</h2><h3 id="1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information"><a href="#1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information" class="headerlink" title="1.

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip! How to Make Horizontal or Vertical Video Using Wondershare Filmora.</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Choose-Vertical-Video-or-Horizontal-Video-for-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Choose-Vertical-Video-or-Horizontal-Video-for-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

An increasing number of people prefer to create a letterbox for their video and upload it to Facebook, as it imparts a cinematic look to the video, and is easy to get more likes. You can see the difference between before and after adding a letterbox</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-compare.jpg"                      alt="pic-compare"                ></p><p>Want to have a try? Come on!</p><h2 id="Get-Started-with-Filmora"><a href="#Get-Started-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Get Started with Filmora"></a>Get Started with Filmora</h2><p>A square video in a <strong>1:1 aspect ratio</strong> is preferred by Facebook. There are varieties of video editing apps available in the market that allows you to create a square video and add a letterbox on it. But most of them have a complicated interface and you might need to watch a lot of video tutorials to make head and tail of it. If you want to add such a letterbox for your Facebook video, Wondershare Filmora may be a good choice for you. Currently, Filmora offers two ways to add a letterbox for your square Facebook video.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch"></a>Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch</h2><p>This method is suitable for users whose source videos are not in square format (1:1). It is a simple method in which the aspect ratios of the source and project videos are compared. In this method, a letterbox will be created automatically when there is a mismatch between the aspect ratio of the original video and the project you are creating using the Filmora application. Let us see how this can be done:</p><ul><li>1. Open Filmora, start the project at <strong>1:1</strong> square or Instagram mode</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="start-filmora9"                ></p><ul><li>2. Go to <strong>File</strong>-<strong>Import Media</strong> and import the source file to the Media library (let’s say it’s 1920*1080 at 16:9)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-sample-video.jpg"                      alt="import-sample-video"                ></p><ul><li>3. Drag and drop the source video to the timeline, and a black letterbox will be created automatically in the preview window, cause the source file didn’t match the 1:1 ratio you set for the project</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="automatic-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>4. Add a subtitle under <strong>Titles</strong> tab to the letterbox at the top and bottom and custom the texts you want.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-letterbox-title.jpg"                      alt="add-letterbox-title"                ></p><p>And you can also go to the <strong>Elements</strong> tab, and add some creative elements such as emoji to the letterbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-elements.jpg"                      alt="add-emoji-elements"                ></p><ul><li>5. Export the square video to local computer in mp4 or other supported formats</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-panel.jpg"                      alt="filmora9-export-panel"                ></p><ul><li>6. Upload the exported square video to Facebook, and show how it looks like on Facebook.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-on-facebook.jpg"                      alt="post-on-facebook"                ></p><h2 id="Method-2-Create-a-Letterbox-by-Adding-Text-Shapes"><a href="#Method-2-Create-a-Letterbox-by-Adding-Text-Shapes" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create a Letterbox by Adding Text Shapes"></a>Method 2: Create a Letterbox by Adding Text Shapes</h2><p>This method is suitable for the source videos in a 1:1 ratio (e.g. 1080*1080). Let us see the steps below:</p><ul><li>1. Start the project at 1:1 square or Instagram mode, and import your source video</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-square-video.jpg"                      alt="import-square-video"                ></p><ul><li>2. Then drag and drop your source video to the timeline. No black bars will appear automatically like in Method 1</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/no-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="no-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>3. To create a letterbox, choose the option <strong>Titles</strong>. Now you will be shown a variety of subtitles and credit styles</li><li>4. Select <strong>Subtitles</strong>, then add a subtitle style that has a black background to your video, such as Subtitle 1,2,3, etc.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-doll-subtitle.jpg"                      alt="add-doll-subtitle"                ></p><ul><li>5. You will see that the subtitle appears on the video in real time. Here you can adjust the width and height of the subtitle. Make it so that that black bar covers the lower end of the video completely and delete the text</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="custom-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>6. Drag and drop the subtitle again from the Titles-Subtitles option. This time for the top section of the video</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-subtitle-again.jpg"                      alt="add-subtitle-again"                ></p><ul><li>7. You can input your own texts in the box or delete the text as you want, and you will be left with a video that has black bars on the top and bottom</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-both-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="get-both-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>8. Export the video to your computer or phone in mp4, then upload it to Facebook, and finally, you will see the magic!</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-my-video.jpg"                      alt="post-my-video"                ></p><h2 id="To-Sum-up"><a href="#To-Sum-up" class="headerlink" title="To Sum up"></a>To Sum up</h2><p>Adding a letterbox, then designing your own texts, elements and filters will bring great creativity to your video on Facebook.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

[4 Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously? [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account. You need to click on the deactivate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deactivate-facebook-account.jpg"                      alt="deactivate FB account to View Facebok Story anonymously"                ></p><p>Once 24 hours is over, you can log in to reactive your account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?"></a>Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?</h2><p>There are three easy ways to see someone’s story on Facebook. One way is to use the web browser of your pc or Mac, the second is exploring Facebook stories on Facebook Messenger, and the third is by using the Facebook mobile app. We will discuss these three methods below.</p><h3 id="Method-1-View-Facebook-Stories-through-the-Website-Browser"><a href="#Method-1-View-Facebook-Stories-through-the-Website-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: View Facebook Stories through the Website Browser"></a>Method 1: View Facebook Stories through the Website Browser</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use any of the browsers on your computer and visit Facebook.Log in, and the home page will be displayed.

This is known as <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This option will be available on your story. Here’s how to check Facebook story viewers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Facebook account on a browser or launch the mobile app, whichever works for you. And then click on the Your Story option.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the viewers’ option that you see towards the bottom left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-who-viewed-facebook-story.jpg"                      alt="View who have seen my Facebok Story"                ></p><p>Now, you can see the list of people’s names who have seen your story.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option.

Make sure to connect to strong WiFi or cellular data.</p><ul><li><strong>Go for a Quick Application Restart:</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes a quick restart can ensure a swift Facebook video play. So, close the Facebook application on your device and relaunch it.

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip!

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

An increasing number of people prefer to create a letterbox for their video and upload it to Facebook, as it imparts a cinematic look to the video, and is easy to get more likes. You can see the difference between before and after adding a letterbox</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-compare.jpg"                      alt="pic-compare"                ></p><p>Want to have a try? Come on!</p><h2 id="Get-Started-with-Filmora"><a href="#Get-Started-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Get Started with Filmora"></a>Get Started with Filmora</h2><p>A square video in a <strong>1:1 aspect ratio</strong> is preferred by Facebook. There are varieties of video editing apps available in the market that allows you to create a square video and add a letterbox on it. But most of them have a complicated interface and you might need to watch a lot of video tutorials to make head and tail of it. If you want to add such a letterbox for your Facebook video, Wondershare Filmora may be a good choice for you. Currently, Filmora offers two ways to add a letterbox for your square Facebook video.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch"></a>Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch</h2><p>This method is suitable for users whose source videos are not in square format (1:1). It is a simple method in which the aspect ratios of the source and project videos are compared. In this method, a letterbox will be created automatically when there is a mismatch between the aspect ratio of the original video and the project you are creating using the Filmora application. Let us see how this can be done:</p><ul><li>1. Open Filmora, start the project at <strong>1:1</strong> square or Instagram mode</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="start-filmora9"                ></p><ul><li>2. Go to <strong>File</strong>-<strong>Import Media</strong> and import the source file to the Media library (let’s say it’s 1920*1080 at 16:9)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-sample-video.jpg"                      alt="import-sample-video"                ></p><ul><li>3. Drag and drop the source video to the timeline, and a black letterbox will be created automatically in the preview window, cause the source file didn’t match the 1:1 ratio you set for the project</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="automatic-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>4. Add a subtitle under <strong>Titles</strong> tab to the letterbox at the top and bottom and custom the texts you want.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-letterbox-title.jpg"                      alt="add-letterbox-title"                ></p><p>And you can also go to the <strong>Elements</strong> tab, and add some creative elements such as emoji to the letterbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-elements.jpg"                      alt="add-emoji-elements"                ></p><ul><li>5. Export the square video to local computer in mp4 or other supported formats</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-panel.jpg"                      alt="filmora9-export-panel"                ></p><ul><li>6. Upload the exported square video to Facebook, and show how it looks like on Facebook.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-on-facebook.jpg"                      alt="post-on-facebook"                ></p><h2 id="Method-2-Create-a-Letterbox-by-Adding-Text-Shapes"><a href="#Method-2-Create-a-Letterbox-by-Adding-Text-Shapes" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create a Letterbox by Adding Text Shapes"></a>Method 2: Create a Letterbox by Adding Text Shapes</h2><p>This method is suitable for the source videos in a 1:1 ratio (e.g. 1080*1080). Let us see the steps below:</p><ul><li>1. Start the project at 1:1 square or Instagram mode, and import your source video</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-square-video.jpg"                      alt="import-square-video"                ></p><ul><li>2.

An increasing number of people prefer to create a letterbox for their video and upload it to Facebook, as it imparts a cinematic look to the video, and is easy to get more likes. You can see the difference between before and after adding a letterbox</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-compare.jpg"                      alt="pic-compare"                ></p><p>Want to have a try? Come on!</p><h2 id="Get-Started-with-Filmora"><a href="#Get-Started-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Get Started with Filmora"></a>Get Started with Filmora</h2><p>A square video in a <strong>1:1 aspect ratio</strong> is preferred by Facebook. There are varieties of video editing apps available in the market that allows you to create a square video and add a letterbox on it. But most of them have a complicated interface and you might need to watch a lot of video tutorials to make head and tail of it. If you want to add such a letterbox for your Facebook video, Wondershare Filmora may be a good choice for you. Currently, Filmora offers two ways to add a letterbox for your square Facebook video.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch"></a>Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch</h2><p>This method is suitable for users whose source videos are not in square format (1:1). It is a simple method in which the aspect ratios of the source and project videos are compared. In this method, a letterbox will be created automatically when there is a mismatch between the aspect ratio of the original video and the project you are creating using the Filmora application. Let us see how this can be done:</p><ul><li>1. Open Filmora, start the project at <strong>1:1</strong> square or Instagram mode</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="start-filmora9"                ></p><ul><li>2. Go to <strong>File</strong>-<strong>Import Media</strong> and import the source file to the Media library (let’s say it’s 1920*1080 at 16:9)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-sample-video.jpg"                      alt="import-sample-video"                ></p><ul><li>3. Drag and drop the source video to the timeline, and a black letterbox will be created automatically in the preview window, cause the source file didn’t match the 1:1 ratio you set for the project</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="automatic-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>4. Add a subtitle under <strong>Titles</strong> tab to the letterbox at the top and bottom and custom the texts you want.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-letterbox-title.jpg"                      alt="add-letterbox-title"                ></p><p>And you can also go to the <strong>Elements</strong> tab, and add some creative elements such as emoji to the letterbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-elements.jpg"                      alt="add-emoji-elements"                ></p><ul><li>5. Export the square video to local computer in mp4 or other supported formats</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-panel.jpg"                      alt="filmora9-export-panel"                ></p><ul><li>6.

Let us see the steps below:</p><ul><li>1. Start the project at 1:1 square or Instagram mode, and import your source video</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-square-video.jpg"                      alt="import-square-video"                ></p><ul><li>2.
