An excellent approach of visual interaction designed previously for slow and limited internet connections now has evolved into a robust and vivid instant communication channel in the world of social media. Happiness makes us want to share, and sadness helps us connect, and GIFs give our emotions the striking visual flair for instant sharing on social media.</p><p>Often you love a GIF on Facebook but are not able to share it with your friends because you could not download it on your PC. To help you easily share your emotions on the social world, and download Facebook GIF, follow the steps below.</p><p>1. Downloading GIFs from Facebook on the PC or a Mac system is a pretty simple and straightforward process. Open the Facebook website on your browser and go to the GIF you want to download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-gif-on-facebook1.jpg"                      alt="open gif on facebook"                ></p><p>2.

It will start downloading the GIF onto your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-gif-as.jpg"                      alt="save gif to your computer"                ></p><p>It was this much simple to download Facebook GIF onto your PC and share it with your friends on the go.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Download-GIF-from-Facebook-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Download-GIF-from-Facebook-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Download GIF from Facebook on Android"></a>Part 2: Download GIF from Facebook on Android</h2><p>Downloading Facebook GIF on an Android device is pretty straightforward and only requires you to do it the right way. To get your favorite GIF on your Android device, follow along with the steps below.</p><p>1. Open the Facebook app on your Android phone.</p><p>2. Head over to the GIF you liked the most and would like to download. Tap the GIF link on the Facebook app, and it will open the GIF in the Facebook app browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-gif-on-facebook-app1.jpg"                      alt="find gif on facebook app"                ></p><p>3. In the Facebook app browser in the top-right corner, you will see a three-dotted menu, tap the menu, and select the option <strong>“Open in Chrome”.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-gif-in-chrome2.jpg"                      alt="open gif in chrome"                ></p><p>4. The Facebook GIF will be opened in the Google Chrome browser window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/see-gif-on-new-page3.jpg"                      alt="see gif on a new page"                ></p><p>5. In the Chrome window, you can now tap and hold on the GIF to show the options menu. A popup menu will appear, and you need to press the <strong>“Download Image”</strong> option, and the download will start.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gif-file4.jpg"                      alt="download gif file"                ></p><p>Great, you’ve downloaded the Facebook GIF on your Android device with this simple and easy hack.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Download-GIF-from-Facebook-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Download-GIF-from-Facebook-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:Download GIF from Facebook on iPhone"></a>Part 3:Download GIF from Facebook on iPhone</h2><p>Apple has put a tight grip on the things a user can perform on their devices, that’s why iPhone users are not allowed to download videos and images directly from the internet on to the internal storage of the device. Downloading GIFs from Facebook and saving it onto your iPhone will require you to follow the steps exactly as I mention down here.</p><p>1. Open the Facebook app on your iPhone.</p><p>2. Now head over to the GIF you want to download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/head-over-gif5.jpg"                      alt="head over gif on iphone"                ></p><p>3. Press the link to open the GIF in the browser.</p><p>4. Facebook will open the GIF in the internal browser window, where you will see the three-dotted menu icon at the top right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-gif-on-iphone6.jpg"                      alt="save gif on iphone"                ></p><p>5.

But how can you make sure that your Page is seen by as many people as possible? And how can you make sure that it appears at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs)?</p><p>Here are a few simple steps that you can take to improve your Facebook Page’s visibility and rank it higher in the SERPs.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-sure-your-Facebook-Page-is-properly-set-up"><a href="#Part-1-Make-sure-your-Facebook-Page-is-properly-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Make sure your Facebook Page is properly set up</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/set-up-facebook-page-properly.jpg"                      alt="set up facebook page properly"                ></p><p>Facebook is a powerful marketing tool for businesses, and a properly set-up page can help you to rank higher in search results and reach more potential customers.</p><p>To start with, make sure that your page includes all of the essential information, such as your business name, address, and contact information. Next, take some time to fill out your profile completely, and include a compelling description of your business.</p><p>Then, start posting relevant, high-quality content on a regular basis. As your page becomes more popular, you’ll start to see an increase in your Facebook ranking.</p><p>By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your Facebook page is working hard for you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description"><a href="#Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Of course, you don’t want to stuff your title and description with keywords - that will just make your Page look spammy. Instead, focus on using a few key phrases that accurately describe what your Page is all about. And make sure that those phrases are prominently featured in both your title and description.</p><p>With a little keyword optimization, you can help ensure that your Facebook page ranks high in search results - and that more people see and engage with your content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms"><a href="#Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

And when it comes to Facebook, one of the best ways to get more exposure for your Page is to promote it on other social media platforms.</p><p>By sharing your Page on Twitter, Instagram, and other sites, you can reach a wider audience and encourage more people to like and follow your Page. Additionally, you can also use paid advertising on social media to target potential customers and get your Page in front of them.</p><p>When done correctly, promoting your Facebook Page on other social media platforms can be a great way to increase your ranking and get more visibility for your business.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Add-fresh-relevant-content-regularly"><a href="#Part-4-Add-fresh-relevant-content-regularly" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

First, try to vary the types of content you post, mixing up text posts, photos, and videos. Second, take advantage of trending topics and hashtags to ensure your content is timely and relevant.</p><p>Finally, don’t be afraid to ask your fans for input - after all, they’re the ones who are most likely to engage with your content! By following these simple tips, you can keep your Facebook ranking high while also providing value for your fans.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Monitor-your-Page’s-analytics-to-track-its-progress"><a href="#Part-5-Monitor-your-Page’s-analytics-to-track-its-progress" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

To carry this out, look into the steps featured below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log into your Facebook account across any device you seem fit to log in through. Find the video that is to be shared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="login with facebook account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the video, you would find the “Share” button adjacent to the “Like” and “Comment” button.

Avoid bombarding your followers with too many posts.</p><ul><li><strong>Know the best times to publish your posts</strong></li></ul><p>If you run a Facebook business page, understand when your audiences are likely to be free. Scheduling posts for early morning publication and evening after work can attract more views and reads.</p><ul><li><strong>Maintain relevance in your posts</strong></li></ul><p>Your Facebook friends and followers are there because they expect certain content from you. As you schedule a post, ensure its in-line with what you advocate for or is related to your business. As in the case of KFC above, all posts are either introducing a new product or promoting an existing product.</p><ul><li><strong>Take advantage of events related to your Facebook post to as you schedule</strong></li></ul><p>Do you want to triple your audience with every Facebook post? There will always be big event related to your page. Create and optimize a post related to the event and schedule it to be published immediately after or during the event.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105869/7443" target="_top" id="2105869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Even though scheduling Facebook posts helps save time, many people are missing the point and just setting any date and time.

Video File Formats Applicable on Facebook</h2><p>As mentioned above, Facebook operates on a list of standards which include specific dimensions, sizes, aspect ratios, and video length.

For instance, the dimension for Facebook stories has to be 500*500 minimum, and its aspect ratio should be 1.91:1 – 9:16. Similarly, the resolution should be 1080*1920 px, with a maximum file size of 4GB, and video length should be within 1 to 15 seconds.</p><p>There is a diverse range of video formats successfully applicable on Facebook.

While some would say that Facebook has lost its edge from a marketing perspective, we do not see it that way. We just believe the nature of Facebook marketing tips has changed. Here are 12 Facebook tips for marketers in 2018 and beyond.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Why Focus on Facebook Marketing</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Facebook Marketing Tips for Beginners</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Focus-on-Facebook-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Focus-on-Facebook-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Focus on Facebook Marketing"></a>Part 1: Why Focus on Facebook Marketing</h2><p>Many marketers wonder whether focusing on Facebook marketing tips is even relevant in 2018. But we argue that when <a class="link"   href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-stats-for-marketers/" >a site has around 2.23 billion monthly users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, boasts 1.15 billion daily mobile users, and is responsible for around one in five page views in the United States, it still matters.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h2 id="Part-2-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-for-Beginners"><a href="#Part-2-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Facebook Marketing Tips for Beginners"></a>Part 2: Facebook Marketing Tips for Beginners</h2><h3 id="1-Create-a-Business-Page-Today"><a href="#1-Create-a-Business-Page-Today" class="headerlink" title="1.

It is a well-meaning idea, but it is not the best way forward.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/set-up-facebook-page" >Having a Facebook business page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will provide you with the content creation tools, paid opportunities and analytics that are only geared for business pages.

But <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/equine-calculator/how-to-claim-your-vanity-url-for-your-facebook-page/474147772600069/" >it is important to choose a different URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Many companies ignore the cover photo and put up some generic, unfocused image. It is a mistake.</p><p>The cover photo takes up a lot of room on your Facebook page, even more room than your profile picture. It should be an image that is attractive, engaging and in keeping with the brand image that you are trying to create around your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-great-cover-photo.JPG"                      alt="facebook cover photo"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Your-“About”-Page"><a href="#4-Optimize-Your-“About”-Page" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Your “About” Page"></a>4. Optimize Your “About” Page</h3><p>One of the most useful Facebook tips for business is to optimize the About section of your business page. When someone first arrives on your page and they are curious about your business, they will go to the About section to get more information.</p><p>There is also a small preview of the page that appears on your home page. It will show nuggets of information, which you can customize to include the most useful details. Your full page should describe the business and mention vital details like your location, hours, website, phone number and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/about-page-facebook.JPG"                      alt="facebook about page"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144274/7443" target="_top" id="2144274">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144274" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144274/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button"><a href="#5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button" class="headerlink" title="5. Add a Call to Action Button"></a>5. Add a Call to Action Button</h3><p>A few years ago, Facebook added a feature that let you include a call to action on your page. For instance, you can ask someone to sign up to a mailing list, watch a video, visit your website or play a game. These calls to action are handy at moving someone from your page to another site where they can continue to learn about your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="facebook call to action"                ></p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook Jail: 10 Secrets to Avoid Being Blocked &#x2F; Get Out of It &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982570">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982570.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982570">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982570.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982570%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982570/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals"><a href="#Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals"></a>Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals</h2><h3 id="6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top"><a href="#6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top" class="headerlink" title="6. Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top"></a>6. Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top</h3><p>Much like you can do on Twitter, it is possible to pin a useful or relevant post to the top of your page. Say it is a post that went viral and you want others who come on your page to learn about it. You could place that post on the top by pinning it there, even if you have newer posts.</p><h3 id="7-Share-Unique-Content"><a href="#7-Share-Unique-Content" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Unique Content"></a>7. Share Unique Content</h3><p>Companies fall into the trap of just posting self-promoting links to their site or other social media channels. While these links are useful when posted on occasion, they should not make up your entire feed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://louisem.com/84350/how-to-create-facebook-content" >You need authentic and interesting posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that your followers would find interesting. That will lead to more reactions and comments, which will help get your posts higher up on Facebook pages for related keywords or hashtags.</p><h3 id="8-Pay-Attention-to-Post-Timing"><a href="#8-Pay-Attention-to-Post-Timing" class="headerlink" title="8. Pay Attention to Post Timing"></a>8. Pay Attention to Post Timing</h3><p>It may sound odd, but the time when you post on Facebook matters a great deal. Early afternoons during the weekday is often the best time to post. It may be that more people are scrolling through their feed and willing to click on links during those times!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="facebook posting time"                ></p><h3 id="9-Response-Time-Matters"><a href="#9-Response-Time-Matters" class="headerlink" title="9. Response Time Matters"></a>9. Response Time Matters</h3><p>When someone posts a comment on your post that is asking a question, it is imperative that you respond quickly. If a customer has a query about your business or a product they bought, they expect an answer within four hours.</p><p>And the average brand takes around 10 hours to respond. It is a serious disconnect. By the time most brands respond, the person has already moved on. You may want to ensure that your social media team is tuned into responding quicker to such posts.</p><h3 id="10-Post-Great-Blog-Content"><a href="#10-Post-Great-Blog-Content" class="headerlink" title="10. Post Great Blog Content"></a>10. Post Great Blog Content</h3><p>Do not treat your blog content as a second class citizen. Give it the promotion it deserves. The most helpful and engaging blog posts will help get you better performance on your Facebook page as well. These posts are helpful and interesting to your target audience - the people following your page!</p><h3 id="11-Promote-Your-Account-to-Add-Followers"><a href="#11-Promote-Your-Account-to-Add-Followers" class="headerlink" title="11. Promote Your Account to Add Followers"></a>11. Promote Your Account to Add Followers</h3><p>Among our Facebook business page tips, it is surprising how many companies do not know they can promote a page to get more followers. You can create an ad within Facebook and target people using precise metrics. It is a great way to create an ad campaign that is targeted, financially prudent and yields good results.</p><h3 id="12-Leverage-Facebook-Insights"><a href="#12-Leverage-Facebook-Insights" class="headerlink" title="12.

Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves. Similar to Apple’s Memoji and Snapchat’s Bitmoji, this new feature allows you to engage and react more authentically with your friends and family across the app.</p><h2 id="Facebook-Avatar-Vs-Bitmoji-Vs-Memoji-Which-One-is-Your-Favorite"><a href="#Facebook-Avatar-Vs-Bitmoji-Vs-Memoji-Which-One-is-Your-Favorite" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?"></a>Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?</h2><p>Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.</p><p>Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-avatar-collection.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Avatar Collection"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.wptv.com/" >www.wptv.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide"></a>How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook"></a>Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook</h4><p>The foremost thing you need to do is ensure you have the newest version of Facebook.

Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves.

Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?</h2><p>Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139110/17108" target="_top" id="2139110">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139110" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139110/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.</p><p>Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-avatar-collection.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Avatar Collection"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.wptv.com/" >www.wptv.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide-3"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide"></a>How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook-3"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook"></a>Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook</h4><p>The foremost thing you need to do is ensure you have the newest version of Facebook.
