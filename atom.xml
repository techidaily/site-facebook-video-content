But, they are unaware of the significance of Facebook SEO and what potential it has for their brand enhancement. If the SEO for your Facebook page is done right, your brand’s Google rankings would move a notch higher. This in turn will <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >attract more influencers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> organically to find you. If you are unsure about the entire process of implementing SEO for Facebook, then here is a quick peek through.</p><p> In this article, we are going to introduce you the significant aspects and ways for enhancing the Facebook SEO strategy for your brand.</p><h2 id="How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO"><a href="#How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO" class="headerlink" title="How to optimize Facebook SEO"></a>How to optimize Facebook SEO</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352555/5172" target="_top" id="352555">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352555" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352555/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Optimize-Facebook-Content"><a href="#1-Optimize-Facebook-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Facebook Content"></a>1. Optimize Facebook Content</h3><p> Speaking of SEO for Facebook page, though, it might not have a direct impact on social media content and popup results for your keyword search on Google. You need to mention the social media platform name in Google search to get the results. Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide" >optimize social media content using keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Links and public posts using those keywords will show up on the search results.</p><p> People click and engage with your content if it’s relevant to them and included in the keywords, and spend more time on your site.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-Page-URL"><a href="#2-Optimize-Page-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize Page URL"></a>2. Optimize Page URL</h3><p> For Facebook SEO, you need to have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.weebly.com/seo/url" >custom URL same as your brand name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL. Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.</p><h3 id="3-Optimize-company-profile"><a href="#3-Optimize-company-profile" class="headerlink" title="3. Optimize company profile"></a>3. Optimize company profile</h3><p> While doing SEO for Facebook page, not every brand optimizes their company profile online. But, it is crucial to optimize and encourage growth of the Facebook fan page for their brands. When you add phone numbers and address on your business page, Google gives more credibility to your page. As a result, your brand’s overall SEO will be enhanced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile.JPG"                      alt="facebook profile"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148772/18498" target="_top" id="2148772">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148772" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148772/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes"><a href="#4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Facebook Notes"></a>4. Optimize Facebook Notes</h3><p> Facebook Notes are utilized to create engagement and inform your fans about important business related news, current crisis or upcoming events. These Notes get indexed post search by Google for business profile only. Through them, you can add keyword rich content and improve the fan page ranks in Google and Bing. Photos as well as the title and Note contain keywords within the caption. After adding captions to your Notes, if users comment in it, then the chances to rank higher increases. If the comments too have keywords as well, the Notes gains more value, attracting engagement and tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/note-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Optimize Facebook Notes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012420/19272" target="_top" id="2012420">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012420" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012420/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868586/19272" target="_top" id="1868586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868586/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page"><a href="#5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page" class="headerlink" title="5. Add Backlink to your fan page"></a>5. Add Backlink to your fan page</h3><p> Facebook SEO requires inbound links to your page, in order to improvise the authoritativeness of your page as per Google for high ranking. Always <a class="link"   href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/external-facebook-fan-30204.html" >include a link to your fan page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from digital channels like blog, website, Twitter profile to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-backlink-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Add Backlink to your fan page"                ></p><h3 id="6-Post-Fresh-Content"><a href="#6-Post-Fresh-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Post Fresh Content"></a>6. Post Fresh Content</h3><p> Fresh, keyword optimized, quality content is important for social media as well as website pages for any brand. It applies to Facebook equally. Unique content helps your brand rank better, but at times you run out of content ideas. Using influencer marketing, you can add fresh content with a new tone to your content marketing drives. Guest posts, product review, and campaigns on social media takeover can help your business to a great extent. Influencers propel their followers for creating unique content for your business. Through hashtags, they might ask their followers to tag them and your brand as well in social media campaigns or share their experiences.</p><h3 id="7-Make-Business-time-Accurate"><a href="#7-Make-Business-time-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="7. Make Business time Accurate"></a>7. Make Business time Accurate</h3><p> Mentioning the business times on your Facebook page is important. In case it changes, you need to immediately update it. Moreover, new location page additions along with correct operational hours and days should be mentioned too. Facebook doesn’t have the feature to allow you customizing hours for special events or holidays, but you can use Facebook posts and advertising to meet that need.</p><h3 id="8-Optimize-featured-Image"><a href="#8-Optimize-featured-Image" class="headerlink" title="8. Optimize featured Image"></a>8. Optimize featured Image</h3><p> To do justice with SEO on your Facebook page, you need to customize your page by adding an avatar&#x2F;profile feature and utilizing the featured image section at its best. Along with photo, you can also add a video or a slideshow in the featured image&#x2F;banner section. Testimonials, team credits can be promoted in this section. Facebook emphasizes that cover photos shouldn’t be misleading, deceptive, or infringe any copyright.</p><h3 id="9-Manage-Customer-Reviews"><a href="#9-Manage-Customer-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="9. Manage Customer Reviews"></a>9. Manage Customer Reviews</h3><p> Customer interaction and engagement is vital for social media platforms and Facebook allows a great deal in this aspect. There needs to be a proper strategy for <a class="link"   href="https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/consumer-laws/customer-service/managing-customer-reviews/tips" >management of comments and reviews, ads and posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Always make sure to respond to reviews, even if they are not what you have expected. It builds trust for your brand. You have the control over enabling or disabling customer reviews.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="Manage Customer Reviews"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148775/18498" target="_top" id="2148775">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148775" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148775/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Include-a-Call-to-Action"><a href="#10-Include-a-Call-to-Action" class="headerlink" title="10. Include a Call-to-Action"></a>10. Include a Call-to-Action</h3><p> Facebook SEO doesn’t typically bring results with regular content sharing. Having a Call-to-Action within your shared links on blogs and product pages on Facebook has more advantages. Click the link, comments, share the post are forms of call to actions here. A compelling CTA actually does the right thing for your post. Without a Call-to-Action, Facebook SEO concept is highly incomplete and hence it is the last and essential tip for you to optimize the SEO of your Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="Include a Call-to-Action"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> From the above article, we are confident that you have got the goodies you wanted to take home and implement with your Facebook brand page. With such amazing features spread across social media, it’s obvious that gathering high ranks over search engine results won’t be a problem for your brand.

It had brought turbulence in the social media world back in 2004 which were embraced by everybody and it is carrying that charm until now! It is a social networking company registered under the name of ‘Facebook, Inc’ which allows its users to communicate with other people. These other people are also defined by users and can be their family, friends, coworkers or potential friends! Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook created this boon of social media in 2004 while he was enrolled at Harvard University with a vision of designing a media platform for college students. But nobody would have imagined its progress graph! By 2006 anyone over the age of 13 with a valid email address could join Facebook. So this social networking website which was supposed to allow users to create profile, share moments through uploading photos and videos and assisted in staying in touch with family and friends for a long time, transformed into one of the much sought after platforms with more than 1 billion users worldwide.</p><p> Facebook is available in 37 different languages which truly reflect its respect towards diversity and it also supports various translation applications if you want to improve existing translation. Being the largest social media network was probably not enough for Facebook and hence the three key public features of Facebook which it has launched are classified as follows:</p><p><strong>Marketplace:</strong> It allows you to discover, buy and sell items in your community. You can post and respond to all sorts of ads of your region.</p><p><strong>Groups:</strong> It allows members to coordinate with near and far friends having common interests. The definition of common interests is open ended, it can be a bachelor party, concert bucket list or project updates, Facebook group lets you communicate in searchable place.</p><p><strong>Events:</strong> These encourage boosting engagement, get people talking, and provide helpful information and links for an upcoming event and ultimately planning and tracking who plans to attend. 650+ million users make use of Facebook Events and 100 million on an average every day to publicize the event!</p><h2 id="Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know"><a href="#Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="Common Facebook Terms which you should know"></a>Common Facebook Terms which you should know</h2><p> If you haven’t joined Facebook until now and feel left out in the group of your friends when they discuss about liking and reacting to a post, updating status, hashtags and tagging then don’t worry! There are lots of terms and phrases which can be termed as ‘Language of Facebook’. These words were in dictionary earlier also but Facebook reinvented their purpose! Warning: They might seem confusing at first but once you enter this world, then these will become your prime words!</p><p><strong>Status Update:</strong> These are text based posts that can describe your mood, thoughts or anything which you want to share with your Facebook friends.</p><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> This is like a page dedicated to you (As good as your profile). You can share information including your pictures, basic information like your favorite books, entertainment shows, celebrity etc.</p><p><strong>News Feed:</strong> You can term it as combination of status and timeline of your friends. News Feed shows you updates from your friends and recent posts from the Facebook pages that you follow. This is where you spend your most of the time!</p><p><strong>Like:</strong> If you enjoyed and want to reach on the profiles of your friends then you choose to Like or Dislike the post.</p><p><strong>Tag:</strong> It is like marking your friends who hold relevance to the pictures or status that you are uploading on your timeline. These then appears on the timeline of your friends and in newsfeed of other friends.</p><p><strong>Notification:</strong> It is like an update from Facebook of the events and occasions where someone has interacted with you. It might be through reacting on what you shared or by posting something on your wall etc.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139115/17108" target="_top" id="2139115">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139115" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139115/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Exploring-Facebook"><a href="#Exploring-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Exploring Facebook"></a>Exploring Facebook</h2><p> Facebook is user friendly and once you create your account, you will feel like exploring all its options and becoming familiar with its adorable features. Here is a quick guide to Homepage and timeline:</p><h4 id="The-homepage"><a href="#The-homepage" class="headerlink" title="The homepage"></a>The homepage</h4><p> As soon as sign in to your Facebook account, you would be redirected to the News Feed. It means your homepage consists of information and images which your friends have shared. It consists of Menu at the very left which contains quick hyperlinks to Events, fun apps and groups that you are part of.</p><p> On the top right, there is a panel which shows notifications, new friends requests and chat messages. This whole section is termed as recent activity panel.</p><p> On the very top you would see a blank space reading like ‘What’s on your mind?’ This is the publisher space where you can update status or add pictures and videos that you would like to share.</p><p> News Feed as we discussed above is what your friends are sharing for you to see. Right panel which read as trending Stories highlights the posts which other are reading and you can click on those hyperlinks for detailed story if you are interested in them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-homepage.jpg"                      alt=" facebook homepage "                ></p><h4 id="The-Timeline"><a href="#The-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="The Timeline"></a>The Timeline</h4><p> The Timeline which represents your profile and is visible to your friends and public (subject to your privacy settings) contains inventory of everything which you have shared and which people has tagged you.

Coverphoto is a picture which can be seen by anybody when they visit your timeline. You can set your personal picture or wallpaper also to express your personality and interests. You can make your profile more informative by adding your school, college, workplace, relationship status and your location etc.</p><p> In short, timeline shows everything which forms part of your profile and also the activities which your friends might have posted on your timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-timeline.jpg"                      alt=" facebook timeline"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037319/7443" target="_top" id="2037319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037319/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Facebook-usage-is-diversified"><a href="#How-Facebook-usage-is-diversified" class="headerlink" title="How Facebook usage is diversified?"></a>How Facebook usage is diversified?</h2><p> There are ample of ways to communicate and staying in touch such as emails, instant messaging or SMS but Facebook has dominated all of them except for professional workspace!

While your conversations at email or IM’s are private, the content that you share on Facebook including photos and links are public. This is because Facebook has emerged as an open network for communication without any sort of limitations and is thus inclined towards being public although you can define privacy and sharing settings for some shared posts.</p><p> The privacy tools can be applied on few posts and information, the remaining information (such as your cover picture) is visible to everybody. Facebook is designed to be more open and social than traditional communication tools.

However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571" >the announcemetn of Mark Zuckerberg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook algorithm will focus on meaningful interactions, resulted in marketers more worrying about their ability to reach a targeted audience in 2024.</p><p>There is also concern about how the <a class="link"   href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/" >Facebook algorithm change <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would impact the ability of businesses to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >work with influencers on the platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The changes are geared towards showing people more content from friends and family, instead of business posts, so the changes in 2024 are so much different than previous changes.</p><p>In this case, it is much more important to know the Facebook algorithm change for marketers in 2024.

The basic meaning is that Facebook cares more about user spending quality on Facebook, rather than just focus on time. Traditionally, time spent is a key factor to measure Facebook’s growth, which results in increasing users’ spending time with all efforts. Now, things are changed. Facebook algorithm decides sharing and commenting are the symbols of meaningful interactions, meaning that Facebook wants you interact with friends. Randomly click likes on a photo, article or video are no longer positive signal to algorithm.</p><p>There <a class="link"   href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/new-facebook-algorithm-26-friends/" >once comes a rumor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook will only show 26 friends in feed, which is false. In fact, Facebook algorithm is broken down into four components. There is <strong>inventory</strong>, <strong>signals</strong>, <strong>predictions</strong> and the <strong>overall score</strong>. Signals are the considerations about content. And it is signals that marketers and businesses must focus on when they are promoting content through the Facebook news feed.</p><p>Signals include the average time spent on content, when it’s posted, the type of story, how many comments or likes it gets, and how often it is shared on the news feed or through Messenger.</p><p>The idea is that Facebook will promote content that gets more engagement, because those are the posts likely to come from family and friends. It is up to marketers to ensure their content is similarly personal and conversation-worthy!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: if you want to get a higher ranking in Facebook feed, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating square videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an important method.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123728/7443" target="_top" id="2123728">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123728" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123728/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors"><a href="#Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors"></a>Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors</h2><p>When it comes to how content is ordered and presented on the Facebook news feed, there are four factors that go into the process. These ranking factors include comments, sharing, reactions and engagement. We explore each factor in depth below:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139557/4704" target="_top" id="2139557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139557/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Comments"><a href="#1-Comments" class="headerlink" title="1. Comments"></a>1. Comments</h3><p>When people or businesses make posts that no one reacts to - those posts are going to be shown a lot less in a person’s feed. Pages that promote conversation and get a lot of engagement will see a significant rise.</p><p>Brands must work on content that is getting people to comment and then converse with each other through the comment chain. It can be a focus on timely and relevant topics, which will get people talking immediately!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="facebook algorithm change comment 2019"                ></p><h3 id="2-Sharing"><a href="#2-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="2. Sharing"></a>2. Sharing</h3><p>Did you know that when <a class="link"   href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/facebook-messenger-link-urls-security/" >a link is shared on Messenger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Facebook users, it has an impact on how that post appears on the feed? Facebook cares about the interactions that people have through the content posted on the site. And that means a focus on content that is shared through Messenger.</p><p>Say a company makes a post that many followers enjoy. They like and&#x2F;or comment on the post. But they also copy the link and share it with friends through Messenger, instead of sharing it publicly on their feed.</p><p>Such shares are just as important as the public sharing. Many companies would focus on the public aspect with previous content. But now they can focus on getting people to share articles through the private chats on Messenger.</p><h3 id="3-Reactions"><a href="#3-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="3. Reactions"></a>3. Reactions</h3><p>People having a reaction to your content is increasingly important. When someone reacts to the comment through the available emojis, the post will be higher up in many followers’ feeds.</p><p>What also matters is the type of reaction they are having. It is said that when someone clicks on the love icon, it has a slightly better impact through the algorithm as compared to the like icon.</p><p>Facebook wants to see people having active and unique reactions to the post. Even the Wow, Sad, Angry and Haha icons have a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/resources/facebook-reactions" >more positive result as compared to the simple likes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-algorithm-change-reaction.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change Reactions"                ></p><h3 id="4-Engagement"><a href="#4-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="4. Engagement"></a>4. Engagement</h3><p>Facebook is going one step further when it comes to the engagement triggers on the algorithm. In the past, having the post shared by different users was enough to see it get a positive bump in the algorithm.</p><p>While those shares are still helpful, the impact is a bit less. What is really needed is a reaction on the shares of your followers.</p><p>Say your company makes a post and it is shared by 50 people. If there are many reactions to the followers of those 50 people when they shared your post, the original post will see a significant bump through the algorithm.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers"></a>Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers</h2><p>The Facebook algorithm changes mean that it will be more challenging to reach people with posts that are made by businesses.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together" >Companies will need a very engaged audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if they want to gain traction on the feed through organic means. And that means posts that are shared, commented on, reacted to and more popular with the Facebook audience. Some pages will start posting something irrelevant with their business. But it is always important to build powerful content like Facebook says.</p><h2 id="Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm"><a href="#Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm"></a>Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm</h2><h3 id="1-Pay-attention-to-video"><a href="#1-Pay-attention-to-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Pay attention to video"></a>1. Pay attention to video</h3><p>Videos tend to attract engagement naturally if the video is good enough. However, have you ever considered live video? Facebook official said live video gets 6 times interactions than regular videos. It is true. In this Facebook algorithm change, <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-live-why-live-video-matters-for-marketers/" >live video matters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. More and more business owners try the new field - live video and they did pretty good. If you haven’t invest live video, now you should start looking for this new method to boost comments and shares.</p><p>Just like Facebook did in May 2. It showed Mark’s opening keynote on Facebook’s latest technology and innovation. Now, this live video has gained more than 1 thousand comments and shares. If you want to make Facebook videos, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It includes various titles&#x2F;text templates, visual effects and audio to make your marketing video perfect.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities"><a href="#2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Engagement Opportunities"></a>2. Create Engagement Opportunities</h3><p>When people have more conversations on your posts, it means those posts are going to be higher up on the feed. Facebook cares about the interactions people are having with content, as they want them to spend more time on the platform.</p><p>Companies often use Facebook to put out basic news stories about the company, new products or discounts. While these posts are interesting, they are not exactly conversation starters. It will be up to businesses to ensure they are creating content that can help people have more meaningful conversations on the platform.</p><p>Sharing news stories that are related to the industry is one way to do this. A company does not always have to promote its own business through Facebook posts. Sharing opinions on changes in an industry that your followers care about is a good way to boost engagement levels, so making engagement opportunities is a great method to rely to Facebook algorithm change.</p><h3 id="3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups"><a href="#3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups" class="headerlink" title="3. Leverage Facebook Groups"></a>3. Leverage Facebook Groups</h3><p>Did you know that around <a class="link"   href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/27/facebook-groups-reaches-1-billion-users/79414710/" >1 billion people use Facebook Groups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? And around 100 million people say that when they are on Facebook, they are primarily using Groups to interact with other people and content.</p><p>Groups are the perfect way to build a community that is active and interested in specific topics. If a business can create groups that are targeting a community, niche or a segment of the market, it will help them boost engagement levels. Posts that are shared within those groups will see a lot of engagement, as they are filled with users who care about the content.</p><p>The impact will not only be felt in rising engagement within those groups, but in the way those posts are ranked in the general feed as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-groups.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads"></a>4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads</h3><p>The changes that Facebook has made to its algorithm were done with the company’s future in mind. Facebook wants to make more money and fuel growth. They do not want a user base that is rarely checking the platform or interacting with content.</p><p>The best advice that we can give to marketers and business owners is to ignore Facebook ads. The company has made changes so that you will turn to ads and simply pay to get your posts to the top of the feed.</p><p>But that does not have to be the case. You can completely ignore ads and focus on the organic efforts that we have mentioned above.

However, you need to be a little smarter and trick the browser into thinking that you are using Facebook from your mobile device. To find out how to save Facebook videos read the steps below:</p><ol><li>Right-click the video and choose ‘Show video URL’. Now copy the URL and paste it into the address bar of your browser.</li><li>Click enter and open the page.</li><li>Now delete the ‘www’ from the URL and type the letter ‘m’.</li><li>Hit the enter button and open the mobile version of the video and hit the play button. If the video starts to play then it’s time for the last step.</li><li>Right-click the video and choose ‘Save video as’.</li><li>Now the video has been saved on your computer so that you can view it as many times as you want.</li></ol><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>15 Best Facebook Analyzers</strong></a><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-3-Facebook-Video-Downloaders-for-Windows-and-Mac"><a href="#Best-3-Facebook-Video-Downloaders-for-Windows-and-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Best 3 Facebook Video Downloaders for Windows and Mac"></a>Best 3 Facebook Video Downloaders for Windows and Mac</h2><h4 id="1-Freemake-Video-Downloader-for-Mac-and-Windows"><a href="#1-Freemake-Video-Downloader-for-Mac-and-Windows" class="headerlink" title="1.

Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves.

Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?"></a>Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?</h2><p>Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.</p><p>Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-avatar-collection.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Avatar Collection"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.wptv.com/" >www.wptv.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide"></a>How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook"></a>Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook</h4><p>The foremost thing you need to do is ensure you have the newest version of Facebook.
