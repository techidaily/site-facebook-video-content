While some would say that Facebook has lost its edge from a marketing perspective, we do not see it that way. We just believe the nature of Facebook marketing tips has changed. Here are 12 Facebook tips for marketers in 2018 and beyond.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Why Focus on Facebook Marketing</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Facebook Marketing Tips for Beginners</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Focus-on-Facebook-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Focus-on-Facebook-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Focus on Facebook Marketing"></a>Part 1: Why Focus on Facebook Marketing</h2><p>Many marketers wonder whether focusing on Facebook marketing tips is even relevant in 2018. But we argue that when <a class="link"   href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-stats-for-marketers/" >a site has around 2.23 billion monthly users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, boasts 1.15 billion daily mobile users, and is responsible for around one in five page views in the United States, it still matters.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h2 id="Part-2-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-for-Beginners"><a href="#Part-2-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Facebook Marketing Tips for Beginners"></a>Part 2: Facebook Marketing Tips for Beginners</h2><h3 id="1-Create-a-Business-Page-Today"><a href="#1-Create-a-Business-Page-Today" class="headerlink" title="1. Create a Business Page Today"></a>1. Create a Business Page Today</h3><p>Do not make the mistake of creating a personal profile page when you are attempting to market your business. It is a well-meaning idea, but it is not the best way forward.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/set-up-facebook-page" >Having a Facebook business page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will provide you with the content creation tools, paid opportunities and analytics that are only geared for business pages. It is why our Facebook tips always start with telling companies to create a dedicated business page today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/business-page-facebook.JPG"                      alt="facebook business page"                ></p><h3 id="2-Claim-a-Unique-URL"><a href="#2-Claim-a-Unique-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Claim a Unique URL"></a>2. Claim a Unique URL</h3><p>When you have a business page, you will be assigned a random URL that delivers you straight to that page. But <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/equine-calculator/how-to-claim-your-vanity-url-for-your-facebook-page/474147772600069/" >it is important to choose a different URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Learn the Importance of a Great Cover Photo</h3><p>Our Facebook business tips always <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cover-photo-size-best-practices" >focus on the cover photo on a business page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Many companies ignore the cover photo and put up some generic, unfocused image. It is a mistake.</p><p>The cover photo takes up a lot of room on your Facebook page, even more room than your profile picture. It should be an image that is attractive, engaging and in keeping with the brand image that you are trying to create around your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-great-cover-photo.JPG"                      alt="facebook cover photo"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Your-“About”-Page"><a href="#4-Optimize-Your-“About”-Page" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Your “About” Page"></a>4. Optimize Your “About” Page</h3><p>One of the most useful Facebook tips for business is to optimize the About section of your business page. When someone first arrives on your page and they are curious about your business, they will go to the About section to get more information.</p><p>There is also a small preview of the page that appears on your home page. It will show nuggets of information, which you can customize to include the most useful details. Your full page should describe the business and mention vital details like your location, hours, website, phone number and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/about-page-facebook.JPG"                      alt="facebook about page"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button"><a href="#5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button" class="headerlink" title="5. Add a Call to Action Button"></a>5. Add a Call to Action Button</h3><p>A few years ago, Facebook added a feature that let you include a call to action on your page. For instance, you can ask someone to sign up to a mailing list, watch a video, visit your website or play a game. These calls to action are handy at moving someone from your page to another site where they can continue to learn about your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="facebook call to action"                ></p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook Jail: 10 Secrets to Avoid Being Blocked &#x2F; Get Out of It &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals"><a href="#Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals"></a>Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals</h2><h3 id="6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top"><a href="#6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top" class="headerlink" title="6. Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top"></a>6. Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top</h3><p>Much like you can do on Twitter, it is possible to pin a useful or relevant post to the top of your page. Say it is a post that went viral and you want others who come on your page to learn about it. You could place that post on the top by pinning it there, even if you have newer posts.</p><h3 id="7-Share-Unique-Content"><a href="#7-Share-Unique-Content" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Unique Content"></a>7. Share Unique Content</h3><p>Companies fall into the trap of just posting self-promoting links to their site or other social media channels. While these links are useful when posted on occasion, they should not make up your entire feed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://louisem.com/84350/how-to-create-facebook-content" >You need authentic and interesting posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that your followers would find interesting. That will lead to more reactions and comments, which will help get your posts higher up on Facebook pages for related keywords or hashtags.</p><h3 id="8-Pay-Attention-to-Post-Timing"><a href="#8-Pay-Attention-to-Post-Timing" class="headerlink" title="8. Pay Attention to Post Timing"></a>8. Pay Attention to Post Timing</h3><p>It may sound odd, but the time when you post on Facebook matters a great deal. Early afternoons during the weekday is often the best time to post. It may be that more people are scrolling through their feed and willing to click on links during those times!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="facebook posting time"                ></p><h3 id="9-Response-Time-Matters"><a href="#9-Response-Time-Matters" class="headerlink" title="9. Response Time Matters"></a>9. Response Time Matters</h3><p>When someone posts a comment on your post that is asking a question, it is imperative that you respond quickly. If a customer has a query about your business or a product they bought, they expect an answer within four hours.</p><p>And the average brand takes around 10 hours to respond. It is a serious disconnect. By the time most brands respond, the person has already moved on. You may want to ensure that your social media team is tuned into responding quicker to such posts.</p><h3 id="10-Post-Great-Blog-Content"><a href="#10-Post-Great-Blog-Content" class="headerlink" title="10. Post Great Blog Content"></a>10. Post Great Blog Content</h3><p>Do not treat your blog content as a second class citizen. Give it the promotion it deserves. The most helpful and engaging blog posts will help get you better performance on your Facebook page as well. These posts are helpful and interesting to your target audience - the people following your page!</p><h3 id="11-Promote-Your-Account-to-Add-Followers"><a href="#11-Promote-Your-Account-to-Add-Followers" class="headerlink" title="11. Promote Your Account to Add Followers"></a>11. Promote Your Account to Add Followers</h3><p>Among our Facebook business page tips, it is surprising how many companies do not know they can promote a page to get more followers. You can create an ad within Facebook and target people using precise metrics. It is a great way to create an ad campaign that is targeted, financially prudent and yields good results.</p><h3 id="12-Leverage-Facebook-Insights"><a href="#12-Leverage-Facebook-Insights" class="headerlink" title="12. Leverage Facebook Insights"></a>12. Leverage Facebook Insights</h3><p>Facebook has an internal analytics tool called Facebook Insights. The final bit of advice among our Facebook tips for business is that you must take advantage of this tool. It has analytics data about how many people are visiting your page and how often they are engaging with your posts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-insights.JPG"                      alt="Facebook Insights"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Facebook tips for business are more important now than ever before. The social media site has an enormous user base, while it has made changes to its algorithm in the past few months. The Facebook tips we have highlighted above should help your business navigate through the social media marketing process in a better way.</p><p>If you want to edit Facebook video, try Filmora to easily better your video with more than 150 effects.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-boosting-your-presence-on-fb-with-virality-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[New] Boosting Your Presence on FB with Virality Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-path-to-an-irresistible-cover-video/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Path to an Irresistible Cover Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-art-of-crafting-captivating-facebook-stories/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Art of Crafting Captivating Facebook Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-download-facebook-videos-on-windows-and-mac/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Download Facebook Videos on Windows and Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-science-behind-engaging-video-content-on-fb/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Science Behind Engaging Video Content on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-access-high-res-fb-media-files/"><u>[New] Access High Res FB Media Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimal-mp4-senders-for-fb-networks/"><u>2024 Approved  Optimal MP4 Senders for FB Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-cryptic-collection-of-2023-auction-for-anonymity-artifacts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Cryptic Collection of 2023  Auction for Anonymity Artifacts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-top-tier-affordable-photo-enhancement-software-online/"><u>[New] Top-Tier Affordable Photo Enhancement Software Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-quick-and-easy-guide-enhance-youtube-shorts-with-new-images/"><u>[Updated] Quick & Easy Guide  Enhance YouTube Shorts with New Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-navigating-the-visual-landscape-key-facts-about-pexelscom-stock-images/"><u>Updated Navigating the Visual Landscape Key Facts About Pexels.com Stock Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-premier-zones-for-cutting-edge-vr-viewing/"><u>[New] Premier Zones for Cutting-Edge VR Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-grandest-editing-illusions-online/"><u>In 2024, The Grandest Editing Illusions Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-integrating-gifs-into-your-iphone-life-with-ease-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Integrating GIFs Into Your iPhone Life with Ease for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/extended-aerial-triumphs-top-10-drones-list-for-2024/"><u>Extended Aerial Triumphs  Top 10 Drones List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capitalizing-on-hairstyle-demonstrations/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Capitalizing on Hairstyle Demonstrations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-google-play-location-on-nokia-c300-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Google Play Location On Nokia C300 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

These photos tell viewers to move their phone around to get details about surroundings. The trend of sharing regular photos on Facebook has gone now and future is all about 360 content.</p><p> As we all know that 360 photos or videos are captured from special cameras that have 360 degree capability. So, most of you might be thinking that you may need to spend a lot to stay tuned to this feature on your device. But the truth is that you need not to buy any expensive camera unit to produce 360 photos for your Facebook post. It doesn’t even require a special 360 degree app to upload interactive pictures.</p><p> Probably you have a tablet or phone that support Facebook live 360 video feature. Actually as per the recent announcement made by Facebook professionals regarding its updated applications, live 360 is compatible with all devices launched after iPad Pro. iPad Air, iPad Mini 2 or iPhone 4S models. Till now Facebook has not revealed any news related to compatibility of new features over Android devices and chances are that Android users need to wait so long to enjoy this feature on their device. However, they made a useful statement that Galaxy devices launched after Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy S5 will support this feature.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-Photos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-With-Built-in-Camera-App"><a href="#Taking-360-Photos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-With-Built-in-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 Photos on iPhone and iPad With Built in Camera App"></a>Taking 360 Photos on iPhone and iPad With Built in Camera App</h2><p> Generally 360 degree camera is most preferable choice for developing high quality 360 degree images but in case if you don’t have one then Panorama feature of built in device cameras can make it possible. However, users cannot get focus from up and down but they can at least pan from right to left by simply swiping on their display. This feature only works for photos that mean you cannot develop 360 videos using Panorama.</p><p> If you are using iPad or iPhone then simple open your camera app and go to Panorama Shooting mode. Start capturing your photo with panoramic photo option but note that you have to follow Facebook photo dimension specifications to develop a live 360 compatible content. However, it is really hard to measure exact dimensions of a panoramic photo when you are working with default settings.</p><p> As soon as you have captured your desired shot, move to your Facebook account and browse photo library. Choose your recently captured panorama photo and then follow instructions provided on screen to update your video. You can also preview your content, now add desired caption and publish your content online. Soon your will start receiving interesting comments and reviews from audience. Users can also delete their 360 degree photos after few hours as per their need. Such types of videos are being commonly used for entertainment and marketing purpose throughout the world.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-Photos-on-Android-Smartphone-with-Google-Street-View"><a href="#Taking-360-Photos-on-Android-Smartphone-with-Google-Street-View" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 Photos on Android Smartphone with Google Street View"></a>Taking 360 Photos on Android Smartphone with Google Street View</h2><p> It is important to capture 360 degree photos in Facebook compatible formats so professionals recommend using Google’s street view camera app for this purpose. It works fine over iOS as well as Android platform and let users enjoy unlimited 360 shoots. To develop 360 degree videos from this application:</p><ul><li>First of all get it installed on your device. You will find a plus sign on your app window, hit this and then select Open Camera option. This app can provide you complete guidelines about how to capture 360 degree images. Note that users need to keep their camera still while capturing such shots.</li><li>Try to move your phone around till the time you notice orange dots on screen. As soon as these dots are there, photos will be captured automatically. There are a tick icon at bottom portion of screen that gets circular border update with every click and once you have captured complete 360 degree motion then it will go green.</li><li>When you are taking last pictures of your 360 shoot, the app will itself remind you about missing points so that you can pick them up. Users can also remove unwanted images from undo icon.</li><li>These captured 360 videos can be uploaded on Facebook same as the regular posts. Simply go to your account, move to status update and select your image, add caption and update.</li></ul><h2 id="Viewing-360-Photos-on-Facebook"><a href="#Viewing-360-Photos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Viewing 360 Photos on Facebook"></a>Viewing 360 Photos on Facebook</h2><p> As soon as you are done with the uploading process, next task is to visit your profile and check if your uploaded video is working fine or not. If you are working on a web browser then simply click on this video and drag it here and there to avail 360 degree view whereas those who are watching it on smartphone can simply move it around in all directions to enjoy 360 degree view.</p><p> You will find a small radar type icon at bottom of screen; it provides information about your current pointing position on view. As it is your own profile so you can still make few changes to your uploads by adjusting preferred audience type or comments etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload

Being dragged through the media mud inspired the company to return to its cores and to offer a unique social media experience for all of its users once more. At the beginning of 2018, it became possible for the first time to <strong>record video calls on Facebook</strong> from an iPhone or iPad that has an iOS.11 or later version of the operating system installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-facebook-video-calls.jpg"                      alt="record facebook video calls"                ></p><p>Facebook was also one of the first social media networks that started offering the live video call option back in 2011. In this article, we are going to provide screen recording solutions for Facebook video call and chat recording on different platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS platforms, and we’ll show you how you can easily record video calls on Facebook.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Record Facebook Video Call on iPhone or iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android devices</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</a></li></ul><h2 id="Method-1-The-Best-Way-to-Capture-Video-Calls-on-Mac-and-Windows-OS"><a href="#Method-1-The-Best-Way-to-Capture-Video-Calls-on-Mac-and-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS"></a>Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS</h2><p>There are many different ways to record a Facebook video call on a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Macbook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or PC, but only a few of them are more efficient than using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Video Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Wondershare’s full-featured software provides a quick and easy way to record all your desktop activities in HD, even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K video quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it also features a video editing mode where you can brush up your videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Filmora can record videos via the built-in or an external webcam record system audio and audio from an external source, which means you record videos using professional equipment. You can start a new screen recording session by clicking on the software’s desktop icon and selecting the Quick Capture mode from the software’s welcome window. Before each session, you should choose the area of the screen you want to record, change the video’s frame rate, and choose the video and audio capturing devices. After you’ve adjusted the settings for the screen recording session, you can start a video call on Facebook and then hit the Record button to start capturing the video.</p><p>Pause or stop recording at any moment by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the software’s toolbar or by using the Hotkey F10. Once the session is complete, the video file you’ve created will be opened in Filmora video editing mode. The software’s video editor offers transitions, cutting, and trimming tools, as well as a rich selection of annotations, filters, and effects. Filmora video editor supports nearly all popular input video file formats, but you can only export Facebook video calls as MP4 or MOV files. The software also enables you to capture videos on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Even though the devices that run on iOS 11 operating systems can record Facebook video calls, in theory, this feature has been inactive recently. The feature functions sporadically even on the iOS 13 version of the operating system. The App Store doesn’t offer too many choices for capturing screens on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>When you install the app on your device, you should enable the Mirroring option in the AirPlay app to project the screen of your iPhone to a computer. Then proceed to make a video call on Facebook and hit the record button displayed on the top of the screen you projected from your phone. The Appersoft app offers support for MP4, FLV, or GIF files, and it can capture footage in 1080p and 720p video resolution. You won’t be able to edit your videos with Appersoft, but the App Store offers a lot of great video editing apps at reasonable prices.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices"></a>Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices</h2><p>The Google Play Store provides a wide range of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and most of them feature enough screen recording tools to enable you to record a video call on Facebook. <strong>DU Recorder</strong> is one of the best options at your disposal because it is completely free and contains no in-app purchases.</p><p>The app lets you adjust frame rates, capture HD videos, and control the video recording settings from the notifications bar. The phone’s front camera can be used to record yourself speaking during the video call on Facebook, and you can also record external sound with the app. Du Recorder offers an alternative storage option that enables you to store Facebook video call recordings in your chosen location.</p><p>Besides being a powerful tool for capturing a screen of an Android device, this versatile app also offers video editing and live streaming services. The Du Recorder’s screen capturing mode can also produce GIF files, which can produce popular social media content.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger"><a href="#Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger"></a>Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-videos-with-fb-messenger.jpg"                      alt="record videos with facebook messenger"                ></p><p>Android users can record all of their video calls from the Facebook Messenger app. You can start recording a video by launching the app and selecting the contact from the People With Messenger list in the Messanger tab. After you’ve selected the contact to whom the video will be sent, you should tap on the Camera button, located near the bottom of the screen, and then place your finger on the ‘Hold send button for video, tap for photo’ button and hold it there while recording the video. The video recording will stop once you lift your finger up and the video will be automatically sent to the contact you selected.</p><p>Using this method, a video captured with Facebook Messenger will not be saved on your Android phone, but you can change this setting and save all your Facebook video calls on your device’s SD card. Tap on your profile picture in the Facebook Messenger app, and find the ‘Photos, Videos, and Emoji’ menu.</p><p>The ‘Download Videos’ option in the ‘Photos, Videos and Emoji’ tab will be set on Wi-Fi Only by default, and you can activate the video download feature simply by tapping on the ON option in the ‘Download Videos’ window. You can disable this option whenever you want if the videos take too much of your phone’s memory by tapping on the OFF button, but the videos you download will play much smoother than the ones stored on the cloud.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Though it is convenient to record the Facebook video calls and chats, we recommend you inform the one who is calling you before recording the video.

Nowadays any iOS user can take stunning 360 degree photos on their iPhone and iPad and upload them directly on Facebook. If you are an iPhone user who is wondering how to create 360 degree photos and videos should keep reading this article where we are going to explain you everything about capturing 360 degrees pictures and videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB"><a href="#How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB" class="headerlink" title="How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB"></a>How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB</h2><p> The introduction of a variety of VR headsets along with a range of cameras with 360 degree video shooting ability is a clear indicator of the fact that the future lies with Virtual Reality. However not all tech enthusiasts would be able to afford these super expensive cameras. This might lead one to believe that 360 degree videos aren’t for people like you and me. However, this is not the fact. In the last few years Apple has enhanced the iPhone cameras to a great extent and these days you can use your iPhone to create casual 360 degree videos. Keep reading to find out the easiest way to capture 360 degree videos on your iPad and iPhone with the help of Splash 360. The best part is that you can do it without spending on any additional hardware.</p><h4 id="Splash"><a href="#Splash" class="headerlink" title="Splash"></a>Splash</h4><p> This is an all new application for iPhone which would help you come up with superb 360 degree photos and videos. It is incredible that Splash has created an application which would allow the users to capture up to 10 videos of 2 seconds duration and then stitch them together to create a new video. All this can be done on your smartphone. It goes without saying that the best part of this application is that you can download it for free. With the help of Splash you will be able to directly upload all your photos and videos on Facebook or share them with your friends through a link. The Splash app also comes with full support for Google Cardboard headsets which would let you fully concentrate in the 360 degree environment.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Splash on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Splash on iPhone</h4><p> Shooting 360 degree videos on Splash is almost child play and it can be mastered even by novices. Let’s take a step by step look at how to shoot 360 degree videos with Splash.</p><ul><li>Open the Splash app and you will be able to see a green button with a camera icon in the home page. Tapping this green button would allow the application to capture videos from the camera of your iPhone.</li><li>In the video interface of the Splash app you will be able to capture a 360 degree video just like capturing a panorama. All you need to do is point the phone at the position where you want to start and the press the shutter button and hold it for shooting the video. Now you can change the position of your camera in whichever way you want and keep recording till you have finished shooting the sphere.</li><li>When you have recorded all the angles by rotating the camera of your iPhone you need to hit the green checkmark.</li><li>In case you are not looking forward to capturing the entire sphere you can always choose to stop shooting midway.</li><li>Lastly you need to save your work before you hit the share button. The sharing option list is right there on the screen- all you have to do is just single tap on it and post your creation wherever you want.</li></ul><p> Tips: Like any other 360 degree recording application which is dependent on the movement of the phone for capturing an entire sphere, the video quality of Splash is going to depend on the stability of the phone while shooting. Therefore make sure not to move much while shooting. No matter how hard you try to keep your hands steady there is surely going to be a few jerks. This is precisely why you need to use a small tripod where you can position the phone and rotate it. Using a tripod is the safest bet since it not only ensures better stability but also gives you enhanced video quality.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens"><a href="#Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens"></a>Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens</h2><p> If you want to create a stunning 360 degree video with your iOS mobile device then you need to make use of an all new 3K 360 degree camera called Insta360 Nano. Insta360 Nano which is available for less than $200 on Amazon is one of the cheapest devices for capturing real cool 360 degree videos. It can also be used as a standalone 360 degree cam which just needs to be connected with your iPhone for viewing your captures, tweaking the settings and for getting a live preview.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone</h4><ul><li>To capture a video&#x2F;photo just connect the Insta360 Nano to your iPhone via lightning.</li><li>Now launch the app and hit the shutter button to shoot. Make sure to keep your camera as still as possible for best results.</li><li>Another way is to insert a Micro SD card into the TF card slot at the bottom of the Insta360 Nano and hit the shutter when the LED turns green in colour.</li></ul><h4 id="Sharing-on-FB"><a href="#Sharing-on-FB" class="headerlink" title="Sharing on FB"></a>Sharing on FB</h4><ul><li>In order to share your captured video you need to hit the Share icon on the top right of the interface.</li><li>Now choose the option which would allow you to export it as a panorama.</li><li>After the export is complete just open the Facebook app and hit the option for uploading photos and videos before uploading your 360 degree file.</li><li>Now just select your hashtags and captions and your 360 capture can be viewed by all your friends and followers.</li></ul><p> If your upload doesn’t go right the first time you need to delete your draft and re-upload it. Since Facebook itself does the job of stitching your 360 degree video together, uploading it can take quite some time. Usually a 20 second clip takes about 5-10 minutes to upload. Your video would appear with a 360 logo on the newsfeed of your friends so as to encourage viewers to enjoy this new 360 degree experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-premier-mp4-broadcast-converter/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Premier MP4 Broadcast Converter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/expert-fb-media-downloader-enhanced-firefox-support-for-2024/"><u>Expert FB Media Downloader  Enhanced FireFox Support for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-maximize-your-income-winning-at-monetizing-social-media-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Maximize Your Income  Winning at Monetizing Social Media Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transition-from-phone-videos-to-televisual-viewing/"><u>2024 Approved  Transition From Phone Videos to Televisual Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/avoid-facebooks-targeted-video-promotions-for-2024/"><u>Avoid Facebook's Targeted Video Promotions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-invisible-viewers-of-fb-episodes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Invisible Viewers of Fb Episodes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-key-tools-selecting-best-6-fb-lite-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Key Tools  Selecting Best 6 FB Lite Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/visualfixpro-review-thorough-examination-of-androvid-editor/"><u>VisualFixPro Review – Thorough Examination of AndroVid Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-foremost-9-digital-mic-recorders-for-high-fidelity-capture/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Foremost 9 Digital Mic Recorders for High-Fidelity Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/camera-control-tips-for-unshakable-images/"><u>Camera Control Tips for Unshakable Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/2024-approved-webm-to-mp3-made-easy-10-reliable-converter-options/"><u>2024 Approved WebM to MP3 Made Easy 10 Reliable Converter Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-creating-compelling-youtube-live-content-with-wirecast/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Creating Compelling Youtube Live Content with WireCast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-great-sound-a-comprehensive-guide-to-fcp-audio-editing/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Great Sound A Comprehensive Guide to FCP Audio Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-discovering-the-best-websites-for-acquiring-high-fidelity-whoosh-soundtracks-for-2024/"><u>Updated Discovering the Best Websites for Acquiring High-Fidelity Whoosh Soundtracks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/overview-of-the-best-lava-blaze-pro-5g-screen-mirroring-app-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Overview of the Best Lava Blaze Pro 5G Screen Mirroring App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/symbolize-your-brand-exclusive-access-to-free-customizable-logos-for-2024/"><u>Symbolize Your Brand  Exclusive Access to Free, Customizable Logos for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

For instance, the dimension for Facebook stories has to be 500*500 minimum, and its aspect ratio should be 1.91:1 – 9:16. Similarly, the resolution should be 1080*1920 px, with a maximum file size of 4GB, and video length should be within 1 to 15 seconds.</p><p>There is a diverse range of video formats successfully applicable on Facebook. Most beginners and even advanced users don’t know the formats. Henceforth, the sub-section has taken the opportunity to mention those formats other than MP4 and MOV.</p><ul><li>MP4 (MPEG-4 video)</li><li>MPE (MPEG video)</li><li>MPEG (MPEG video)</li><li>MPEG4 (MPEG-4 video)</li><li>M2TS (M2TS video)</li><li>M4V (MPEG-4 video)</li><li>MKV (Matroska format)</li><li>MOD (MOD video)</li><li>MOV (QuickTime movie)</li><li>MPG (MPEG video)</li><li>MTS (AVCHD video)</li><li>DIVX (DIVX video)</li><li>OGV (Ogg video format)</li><li>QT (QuickTime movie)</li><li>TOD (TOD video)</li><li>TS (MPEG transport stream)</li><li>VOB (DVD video)</li><li>WMV (Windows Media Video)</li><li>DV (DV video)</li><li>F4V (Flash video)</li><li>FLV (Flash video)</li><li>GIF (graphics interchange format)</li><li>NSV (Nullsoft video)</li><li>OGM (Ogg media format)</li><li>3G2 (mobile video)</li><li>3GP (mobile video)</li><li>3GPP (mobile video)</li><li>ASF (Windows Media video)</li><li>AVI (AVI video)</li><li>DAT (MPEG video)</li></ul><h2 id="Closing-Words-3"><a href="#Closing-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Closing Words"></a>Closing Words</h2><p>Facebook influencers and business owners need to work hard for brand awareness and visibility, done with different media types.

However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571" >the announcemetn of Mark Zuckerberg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook algorithm will focus on meaningful interactions, resulted in marketers more worrying about their ability to reach a targeted audience in 2024.</p><p>There is also concern about how the <a class="link"   href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/" >Facebook algorithm change <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would impact the ability of businesses to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >work with influencers on the platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The changes are geared towards showing people more content from friends and family, instead of business posts, so the changes in 2024 are so much different than previous changes.</p><p>In this case, it is much more important to know the Facebook algorithm change for marketers in 2024. How can marketers work around these changes?

The basic meaning is that Facebook cares more about user spending quality on Facebook, rather than just focus on time. Traditionally, time spent is a key factor to measure Facebook’s growth, which results in increasing users’ spending time with all efforts. Now, things are changed. Facebook algorithm decides sharing and commenting are the symbols of meaningful interactions, meaning that Facebook wants you interact with friends. Randomly click likes on a photo, article or video are no longer positive signal to algorithm.</p><p>There <a class="link"   href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/new-facebook-algorithm-26-friends/" >once comes a rumor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook will only show 26 friends in feed, which is false. In fact, Facebook algorithm is broken down into four components. There is <strong>inventory</strong>, <strong>signals</strong>, <strong>predictions</strong> and the <strong>overall score</strong>. Signals are the considerations about content. And it is signals that marketers and businesses must focus on when they are promoting content through the Facebook news feed.</p><p>Signals include the average time spent on content, when it’s posted, the type of story, how many comments or likes it gets, and how often it is shared on the news feed or through Messenger.</p><p>The idea is that Facebook will promote content that gets more engagement, because those are the posts likely to come from family and friends. It is up to marketers to ensure their content is similarly personal and conversation-worthy!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: if you want to get a higher ranking in Facebook feed, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating square videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an important method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors"><a href="#Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors"></a>Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors</h2><p>When it comes to how content is ordered and presented on the Facebook news feed, there are four factors that go into the process. These ranking factors include comments, sharing, reactions and engagement. We explore each factor in depth below:</p><h3 id="1-Comments"><a href="#1-Comments" class="headerlink" title="1. Comments"></a>1. Comments</h3><p>When people or businesses make posts that no one reacts to - those posts are going to be shown a lot less in a person’s feed. Pages that promote conversation and get a lot of engagement will see a significant rise.</p><p>Brands must work on content that is getting people to comment and then converse with each other through the comment chain. It can be a focus on timely and relevant topics, which will get people talking immediately!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="facebook algorithm change comment 2019"                ></p><h3 id="2-Sharing"><a href="#2-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="2. Sharing"></a>2. Sharing</h3><p>Did you know that when <a class="link"   href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/facebook-messenger-link-urls-security/" >a link is shared on Messenger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Facebook users, it has an impact on how that post appears on the feed? Facebook cares about the interactions that people have through the content posted on the site. And that means a focus on content that is shared through Messenger.</p><p>Say a company makes a post that many followers enjoy. They like and&#x2F;or comment on the post. But they also copy the link and share it with friends through Messenger, instead of sharing it publicly on their feed.</p><p>Such shares are just as important as the public sharing. Many companies would focus on the public aspect with previous content. But now they can focus on getting people to share articles through the private chats on Messenger.</p><h3 id="3-Reactions"><a href="#3-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="3. Reactions"></a>3. Reactions</h3><p>People having a reaction to your content is increasingly important. When someone reacts to the comment through the available emojis, the post will be higher up in many followers’ feeds.</p><p>What also matters is the type of reaction they are having. It is said that when someone clicks on the love icon, it has a slightly better impact through the algorithm as compared to the like icon.</p><p>Facebook wants to see people having active and unique reactions to the post. Even the Wow, Sad, Angry and Haha icons have a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/resources/facebook-reactions" >more positive result as compared to the simple likes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-algorithm-change-reaction.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change Reactions"                ></p><h3 id="4-Engagement"><a href="#4-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="4. Engagement"></a>4. Engagement</h3><p>Facebook is going one step further when it comes to the engagement triggers on the algorithm. In the past, having the post shared by different users was enough to see it get a positive bump in the algorithm.</p><p>While those shares are still helpful, the impact is a bit less. What is really needed is a reaction on the shares of your followers.</p><p>Say your company makes a post and it is shared by 50 people. If there are many reactions to the followers of those 50 people when they shared your post, the original post will see a significant bump through the algorithm.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers"></a>Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers</h2><p>The Facebook algorithm changes mean that it will be more challenging to reach people with posts that are made by businesses.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together" >Companies will need a very engaged audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if they want to gain traction on the feed through organic means. And that means posts that are shared, commented on, reacted to and more popular with the Facebook audience. Some pages will start posting something irrelevant with their business. But it is always important to build powerful content like Facebook says.</p><h2 id="Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm"><a href="#Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm"></a>Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm</h2><h3 id="1-Pay-attention-to-video"><a href="#1-Pay-attention-to-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Pay attention to video"></a>1. Pay attention to video</h3><p>Videos tend to attract engagement naturally if the video is good enough. However, have you ever considered live video? Facebook official said live video gets 6 times interactions than regular videos. It is true. In this Facebook algorithm change, <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-live-why-live-video-matters-for-marketers/" >live video matters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. More and more business owners try the new field - live video and they did pretty good. If you haven’t invest live video, now you should start looking for this new method to boost comments and shares.</p><p>Just like Facebook did in May 2. It showed Mark’s opening keynote on Facebook’s latest technology and innovation. Now, this live video has gained more than 1 thousand comments and shares. If you want to make Facebook videos, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It includes various titles&#x2F;text templates, visual effects and audio to make your marketing video perfect.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities"><a href="#2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Engagement Opportunities"></a>2. Create Engagement Opportunities</h3><p>When people have more conversations on your posts, it means those posts are going to be higher up on the feed. Facebook cares about the interactions people are having with content, as they want them to spend more time on the platform.</p><p>Companies often use Facebook to put out basic news stories about the company, new products or discounts. While these posts are interesting, they are not exactly conversation starters. It will be up to businesses to ensure they are creating content that can help people have more meaningful conversations on the platform.</p><p>Sharing news stories that are related to the industry is one way to do this. A company does not always have to promote its own business through Facebook posts. Sharing opinions on changes in an industry that your followers care about is a good way to boost engagement levels, so making engagement opportunities is a great method to rely to Facebook algorithm change.</p><h3 id="3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups"><a href="#3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups" class="headerlink" title="3. Leverage Facebook Groups"></a>3. Leverage Facebook Groups</h3><p>Did you know that around <a class="link"   href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/27/facebook-groups-reaches-1-billion-users/79414710/" >1 billion people use Facebook Groups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? And around 100 million people say that when they are on Facebook, they are primarily using Groups to interact with other people and content.</p><p>Groups are the perfect way to build a community that is active and interested in specific topics. If a business can create groups that are targeting a community, niche or a segment of the market, it will help them boost engagement levels. Posts that are shared within those groups will see a lot of engagement, as they are filled with users who care about the content.</p><p>The impact will not only be felt in rising engagement within those groups, but in the way those posts are ranked in the general feed as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-groups.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads"></a>4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads</h3><p>The changes that Facebook has made to its algorithm were done with the company’s future in mind. Facebook wants to make more money and fuel growth. They do not want a user base that is rarely checking the platform or interacting with content.</p><p>The best advice that we can give to marketers and business owners is to ignore Facebook ads. The company has made changes so that you will turn to ads and simply pay to get your posts to the top of the feed.</p><p>But that does not have to be the case. You can completely ignore ads and focus on the organic efforts that we have mentioned above. Those will get you the higher levels of engagement that you need to remain relevant with the new algorithm. But you can still <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make ads by Facebook video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="5-Stick-to-strong-content"><a href="#5-Stick-to-strong-content" class="headerlink" title="5. Stick to strong content"></a>5. Stick to strong content</h3><p>It is understandable for companies to feel as though a scary change has taken place on Facebook. The way that posts are prioritized in the feed is different to what it was before. Facebook claims it is all about getting family and friend posts closer to the top of the feed.</p><p>But like any algorithm change, marketers can react to ensure the content they are promoting is being seen by as many people as possible. <a class="link"   href="https://www.naturettl.com/upload-photos-facebook-best-quality-possible/" >Improving engagement and promoting conversation-worthy content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can help make that happen.</p><h3 id="6-Try-Facebook-influencer"><a href="#6-Try-Facebook-influencer" class="headerlink" title="6. Try Facebook influencer"></a>6. Try Facebook influencer</h3><p>Have you experienced posting a image without any engagement, even likes? If it happens, you should change your posting strategy.

But how can you make sure that your Page is seen by as many people as possible? And how can you make sure that it appears at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs)?</p><p>Here are a few simple steps that you can take to improve your Facebook Page’s visibility and rank it higher in the SERPs.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-sure-your-Facebook-Page-is-properly-set-up"><a href="#Part-1-Make-sure-your-Facebook-Page-is-properly-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Make sure your Facebook Page is properly set up"></a>Part 1. Make sure your Facebook Page is properly set up</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/set-up-facebook-page-properly.jpg"                      alt="set up facebook page properly"                ></p><p>Facebook is a powerful marketing tool for businesses, and a properly set-up page can help you to rank higher in search results and reach more potential customers.</p><p>To start with, make sure that your page includes all of the essential information, such as your business name, address, and contact information. Next, take some time to fill out your profile completely, and include a compelling description of your business.</p><p>Then, start posting relevant, high-quality content on a regular basis. As your page becomes more popular, you’ll start to see an increase in your Facebook ranking.</p><p>By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your Facebook page is working hard for you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description"><a href="#Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Of course, you don’t want to stuff your title and description with keywords - that will just make your Page look spammy. Instead, focus on using a few key phrases that accurately describe what your Page is all about. And make sure that those phrases are prominently featured in both your title and description.</p><p>With a little keyword optimization, you can help ensure that your Facebook page ranks high in search results - and that more people see and engage with your content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms"><a href="#Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

And when it comes to Facebook, one of the best ways to get more exposure for your Page is to promote it on other social media platforms.</p><p>By sharing your Page on Twitter, Instagram, and other sites, you can reach a wider audience and encourage more people to like and follow your Page. Additionally, you can also use paid advertising on social media to target potential customers and get your Page in front of them.</p><p>When done correctly, promoting your Facebook Page on other social media platforms can be a great way to increase your ranking and get more visibility for your business.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Add-fresh-relevant-content-regularly"><a href="#Part-4-Add-fresh-relevant-content-regularly" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

This not only keeps your page active and engaging, but it also helps Facebook’s algorithms to see your page as valuable and worth promoting. Of course, posting quality content can be a challenge, especially if you’re running a busy page.</p><p>However, there are a few simple strategies you can use to make sure your content is always top-notch. First, try to vary the types of content you post, mixing up text posts, photos, and videos. Second, take advantage of trending topics and hashtags to ensure your content is timely and relevant.</p><p>Finally, don’t be afraid to ask your fans for input - after all, they’re the ones who are most likely to engage with your content! By following these simple tips, you can keep your Facebook ranking high while also providing value for your fans.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Monitor-your-Page’s-analytics-to-track-its-progress"><a href="#Part-5-Monitor-your-Page’s-analytics-to-track-its-progress" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

This will give you a clear picture of how your page is performing and where it needs to improve. There are a number of different metrics you should be tracking, including your page views, likes, and shares.</p><p>By monitoring these metrics, you’ll be able to see which content is resonating with your audience and which content isn’t. You can also use this data to adjust your content strategy and ensure that your page is consistently delivering high-quality content that helps it rank.</p><p>So, if you’re looking to make your Facebook page rank, start by monitoring your page’s analytics.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Ask-your-followers-to-recommend-your-Page-to-their-friends"><a href="#Part-6-Ask-your-followers-to-recommend-your-Page-to-their-friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 6.

If your followers are happy with your content, they’ll be more than happy to recommend your Page to their friends.</p><p>And the more people who Like and follow your Page, the higher it will rank in Facebook’s algorithms. That means that your content will be more likely to show up in people’s News Feeds, and you’ll get more opportunities to engage with potential customers.</p><p>So, if you’re looking to give your Facebook Page a boost, just ask your followers to recommend it to their friends.

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip!

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well.

Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience</strong></p><p>The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one’s appearance.</p><p><strong>#2. Introduce the Solution</strong></p><p>Once you’ve connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.</p><p><strong>#3. Call to Action</strong></p><p>The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.</p><p>For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like “Click here to learn more about our weight loss product.”</p><p><strong>Example of Facebook ads Creative Image</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/creative-facebook-ads-example.jpg"                      alt="creative facebook ads example"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three simple structures for creating a creative image for your Facebook Ads, it’s time to get started!
