Optimize Facebook Content</h3><p> Speaking of SEO for Facebook page, though, it might not have a direct impact on social media content and popup results for your keyword search on Google. You need to mention the social media platform name in Google search to get the results. Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide" >optimize social media content using keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL. Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.</p><h3 id="3-Optimize-company-profile"><a href="#3-Optimize-company-profile" class="headerlink" title="3. Optimize company profile"></a>3. Optimize company profile</h3><p> While doing SEO for Facebook page, not every brand optimizes their company profile online.

When you add phone numbers and address on your business page, Google gives more credibility to your page. As a result, your brand’s overall SEO will be enhanced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile.JPG"                      alt="facebook profile"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094422/7443" target="_top" id="2094422">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094422" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094422/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes"><a href="#4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes" class="headerlink" title="4.

Optimize Facebook Notes</h3><p> Facebook Notes are utilized to create engagement and inform your fans about important business related news, current crisis or upcoming events. These Notes get indexed post search by Google for business profile only. Through them, you can add keyword rich content and improve the fan page ranks in Google and Bing. Photos as well as the title and Note contain keywords within the caption. After adding captions to your Notes, if users comment in it, then the chances to rank higher increases. If the comments too have keywords as well, the Notes gains more value, attracting engagement and tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/note-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Optimize Facebook Notes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page"><a href="#5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page" class="headerlink" title="5.

Always <a class="link"   href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/external-facebook-fan-30204.html" >include a link to your fan page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from digital channels like blog, website, Twitter profile to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-backlink-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Add Backlink to your fan page"                ></p><h3 id="6-Post-Fresh-Content"><a href="#6-Post-Fresh-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Post Fresh Content"></a>6. Post Fresh Content</h3><p> Fresh, keyword optimized, quality content is important for social media as well as website pages for any brand. It applies to Facebook equally. Unique content helps your brand rank better, but at times you run out of content ideas. Using influencer marketing, you can add fresh content with a new tone to your content marketing drives. Guest posts, product review, and campaigns on social media takeover can help your business to a great extent. Influencers propel their followers for creating unique content for your business. Through hashtags, they might ask their followers to tag them and your brand as well in social media campaigns or share their experiences.</p><h3 id="7-Make-Business-time-Accurate"><a href="#7-Make-Business-time-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="7. Make Business time Accurate"></a>7. Make Business time Accurate</h3><p> Mentioning the business times on your Facebook page is important. In case it changes, you need to immediately update it. Moreover, new location page additions along with correct operational hours and days should be mentioned too. Facebook doesn’t have the feature to allow you customizing hours for special events or holidays, but you can use Facebook posts and advertising to meet that need.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902294/19272" target="_top" id="1902294">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902294" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902294/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Optimize-featured-Image"><a href="#8-Optimize-featured-Image" class="headerlink" title="8.

Along with photo, you can also add a video or a slideshow in the featured image&#x2F;banner section. Testimonials, team credits can be promoted in this section. Facebook emphasizes that cover photos shouldn’t be misleading, deceptive, or infringe any copyright.</p><h3 id="9-Manage-Customer-Reviews"><a href="#9-Manage-Customer-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="9. Manage Customer Reviews"></a>9. Manage Customer Reviews</h3><p> Customer interaction and engagement is vital for social media platforms and Facebook allows a great deal in this aspect. There needs to be a proper strategy for <a class="link"   href="https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/consumer-laws/customer-service/managing-customer-reviews/tips" >management of comments and reviews, ads and posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Include a Call-to-Action"></a>10. Include a Call-to-Action</h3><p> Facebook SEO doesn’t typically bring results with regular content sharing. Having a Call-to-Action within your shared links on blogs and product pages on Facebook has more advantages. Click the link, comments, share the post are forms of call to actions here. A compelling CTA actually does the right thing for your post. Without a Call-to-Action, Facebook SEO concept is highly incomplete and hence it is the last and essential tip for you to optimize the SEO of your Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="Include a Call-to-Action"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> From the above article, we are confident that you have got the goodies you wanted to take home and implement with your Facebook brand page.

A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers.

This page gives you many options on how to set up your stream. Look at the left-side panel options. You can choose which camera you want as your input source. Select the microphone you want to use on the page. Below the microphone icon is the button for ‘Start Screen Share.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-12.png"                      alt="share screen on facebook live"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you click on ‘Start Screen Share,’ a new dialog box pops open.

This creates a “Post Preview.” You can see what the post will look like when it goes live. Click on ‘Next’ on the bottom left of the screen to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-13.png"                      alt="fill in title on facebook live video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Simply fill out the live stream post details on the left side panel.

The user can set up the settings according to streaming and recording screens. On the other hand, they can only look forward to optimizing options according to recording the screens. For connecting and configuring audio and video across OBS, set up the sources across the Auto-Configuration Wizard and proceed towards finalization.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On configuring the settings, run OBS Studio and test the streaming services before <strong>stream Twitch to Facebook Live.</strong> It is impossible to perform cross-sharing across Twitch exact; thus, there is a need to configure an applet for Twitch and Facebook to help share the stream with Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="check your obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Get started by setting up the free IFTTT account.

The user can set up the settings according to streaming and recording screens. On the other hand, they can only look forward to optimizing options according to recording the screens. For connecting and configuring audio and video across OBS, set up the sources across the Auto-Configuration Wizard and proceed towards finalization.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On configuring the settings, run OBS Studio and test the streaming services before <strong>stream Twitch to Facebook Live.</strong> It is impossible to perform cross-sharing across Twitch exact; thus, there is a need to configure an applet for Twitch and Facebook to help share the stream with Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="check your obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Get started by setting up the free IFTTT account.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Becoming-a-Trendsetter-Viral-Tactics-for-FB"><a href="#Becoming-a-Trendsetter-Viral-Tactics-for-FB" class="headerlink" title="Becoming a Trendsetter: Viral Tactics for FB"></a>Becoming a Trendsetter: Viral Tactics for FB</h2><p>If you want your Facebook page to go viral, it’s not enough to just post content. You have to find the right type of content that people will share with their friends. We all know that some posts are more likely than others to get shared on social media—but what makes them so clickable? Well, there are several different types of Facebook-ready material out there in the world:</p><h2 id="Contests-and-Giveaways"><a href="#Contests-and-Giveaways" class="headerlink" title="Contests and Giveaways"></a>Contests and Giveaways</h2><p>Contests and giveaways are a great way to get people to engage with your page. While it’s important to make sure that the contest is fun, easy, and not too much work for you, you should also think about what kind of prizes would be relevant and interesting to people who visit your page.</p><p>Remember: giveaways should be something people want! A good prize will help attract more participation in the contest and create buzz around your brand.</p><p>Contest Alert from Enchanted Kingdom is the perfect Facebook contest idea to generate excitement for their upcoming events.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087234/19272" target="_top" id="2087234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087234/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Your-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Life Events"></a>Your Life Events</h2><p>As a business owner, you want to create a buzz on Facebook. You’ve tried posting ads and boosting posts, but that doesn’t seem to be working for you. The answer is simple: post about your life events!</p><p>You don’t have to be an attendee of someone else’s wedding or send out birth announcements every time one of your family members gives birth; however, if you have something exciting going on in your life (or even just funny stories) there are plenty of opportunities for viral content.</p><p>These types of posts can really boost the engagement on your page because they show off the human side of being a business owner—you’re not just posting about how great your services are; people get excited when they see that their favorite barista had a baby or experienced some kind of major success in life.</p><p>A great example of a life event post is when Mark Zuckerberg’s post is coming baby with Priscilla Chan. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and Priscilla Chan are going to have a baby, the reaction from the audience ranged anywhere between congratulations and excitement for their future kid. The post has since gone viral with over 1.3 reactions!</p><h2 id="Your-Company’s-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Company’s-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Company’s Life Events"></a>Your Company’s Life Events</h2><ul><li>Share milestones and achievements. This is one of the easiest ways to create a buzz on Facebook. No matter if you’re celebrating a major accomplishment or simply adding a new employee to your team, highlight it! Has some sort of contest or giveaway that encourages fans to join in on the celebration (i.e., “Like this post if you want us to throw you a party”).</li><li>Share news about your company. Stay connected with customers by sharing news and updates regarding your company, products, services, and more – especially if they are relevant to what people are talking about in their social networks at that time (i.e., Trending Topics). For example: “Want a sneak peek at our upcoming product launch? Click here.” If there’s something going on in your industry that’s creating buzz throughout social networks, be sure not only to talk about it but also show how it relates back to what makes your business special&#x2F;different from everyone else out there!</li></ul><p>Take a look at Ford’s post about their Media’s Awards Choice in the years 2020-2021. It features the Ford Ranger and Ford Mustang. It’s a great post if you’re interested in cars.</p><h2 id="Seasonal-and-Holiday-Posts"><a href="#Seasonal-and-Holiday-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Seasonal and Holiday Posts"></a>Seasonal and Holiday Posts</h2><ul><li>Use the holiday to your advantage. While you may not be able to get in on the actual celebrations, you can still use the holidays and seasonal content to your advantage. For example, if it’s Halloween time, consider posting pictures from last year’s party! People love nostalgia and will share those posts with their friends in no time.</li><li>Create a holiday giveaway or contest. Customers love free stuff! Create a competition that includes everyone; even if someone does not win anything valuable (although this is always appreciated), they will still feel appreciated for joining your page because they were given the chance at receiving something nice as well as help out their favorite business by spreading awareness about it through social media sharing of their own.</li></ul><p>Check this Mother’s Day post from Mason Cash with their mechanics of Like, Follow &amp; comment to win a Mother’s Day bundle worth over $75.</p><h2 id="Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist"><a href="#Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist" class="headerlink" title="Classic Photos with a Twist"></a>Classic Photos with a Twist</h2><p>One way to get your photo on the front page of Facebook is with a classic picture. But you can’t just post any old photo and hope for the best. You need to make sure that the image looks as good as possible, and it needs to be relevant to your business or brand.</p><p>While most people think of their feed as a place where they’ll see pictures of friends and family, there are plenty of opportunities here for businesses too—if they know what they’re doing. A good caption will also help keep your audience engaged by adding value to the photo; don’t go overboard with hashtags though, because that’s one way of making it harder for people who aren’t following you yet (or who have never heard of you) from finding this information later on down the line when they decide whether or not they want something from your store&#x2F;organization&#x2F;etcetera.”</p><p>The photo of this simple yet creative picture with 308 reactions, 55 comments, and 13 shares from Lenovo is one among many examples of a classic photo with a twist post.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975562">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975562">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975562%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975562/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos"><a href="#Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos" class="headerlink" title="Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)"></a>Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)</h2><p>Photos of animals are the most popular content on Facebook and for good reason. They’re cute! They’re funny! And they make you feel things—maybe even happy or inspired. In other words, they’re relatable in a way that other posts aren’t.</p><p>There’s also the fact that photos of animals can be used to promote your brand in subtle ways. For example, if you have an animal-related product or business (cat food company), then including cats in your photos will attract cat lovers who might not otherwise follow you on social media.</p><p>Check out one of the amazing Subaru of America, Inc. commercials featuring one of Golden Meadows puppies, Amber, learning how to parallel park!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082527/7443" target="_top" id="2082527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring"><a href="#Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring" class="headerlink" title="Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring"></a>Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring</h2><p>The best way to get likes, comments, and shares on your Facebook page is by posting high-quality content that people will want to share with their friends. The reason why a post goes viral on Facebook is that it’s either informative or entertaining.</p><ul><li>For inspiration: Post something that motivates the reader and makes them feel good about themselves or their life situation. You can do this in many ways such as sharing quotes from famous people, funny videos or photos, etc.</li><li>For fun: Post things that make the readers laugh like funny photos, memes or cartoons&#x2F;drawings of characters from popular movies&#x2F;cartoon series like Pokemon Go! Which has become a global phenomenon!</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS:</strong> Wondershare Filmora can help you to create stunning videos that can go viral.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, anyone can create stunning videos that are sure to capture the attention of the online world.

We believe that hashtags on Facebook are a very useful tool for marketers as they can help you attract influencers and followers. This article will go into detail about the best way to use Facebook hashtags.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-You-Should-Use-Facebook-Hashtags"><a href="#Part-1-Why-You-Should-Use-Facebook-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags"></a>Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags</h2><h3 id="1-Hashtags-Connect-Your-Content"><a href="#1-Hashtags-Connect-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Hashtags Connect Your Content"></a>1. Hashtags Connect Your Content</h3><p> The reason why it is so useful to use hashtags on Facebook is because they will help you connect your content with other people who may be interested in what you have to say. It is likely that other people are posting about similar topics, products or services.</p><p> Hashtags lets you form a connection with those people. Your content is easily accessible with hashtags, as anyone who is browsing through the current posts on that hashtag will see your posts.</p><h3 id="2-Expand-Your-Reach"><a href="#2-Expand-Your-Reach" class="headerlink" title="2. Expand Your Reach"></a>2. Expand Your Reach</h3><p> Using hashtags is a win-win approach on Facebook. There is no downside associated with adding a couple hashtags to every Facebook post. And the upside is huge.</p><p> A hashtag delivers expanded reach on the platform. A previous post would only be seen by followers or those who specifically search for your business name on the platform. Hashtags ensure that anyone clicking on a hashtag and browsing through the feed may come across your content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags"><a href="#Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags"></a>Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags</h2><p> Hashtags are a concept that first started on Twitter, where individuals were able to add a # before writing a word or phrase. The hashtag is a searchable device on these social media platforms, as a person is able to click on the hashtag and see other posts that include it as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >Every hashtag that is created on Facebook has its own URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When someone clicks on the hashtag, they immediately go to that page, where they can see other posts from the same hashtag.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-Properly"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-Properly" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly"></a>Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly</h2><h3 id="1-Use-Popular-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Use-Popular-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Popular Hashtags"></a>1. Use Popular Hashtags</h3><p> The first rule to succeeding with hashtags is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamtechie.com/2013/05/an-update-on-facebook-and-hashtags/" >use ones that are already very popular <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These are branded or social community hashtags that everyone uses on a regular basis.</p><p> For instance, a hashtag such as #MotivationMonday is a common example of a popular hashtag. But a company could also use a single hashtag for all its posts, creating a branded hashtag. As the company becomes more popular, the usefulness of that hashtag would increase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-facebook-hashtags.JPG"                      alt="popular facebook hashtag"                ></p><h3 id="2-Cross-Social-Performance"><a href="#2-Cross-Social-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross Social Performance"></a>2. Cross Social Performance</h3><p> A useful side effect of Facebook adding hashtags is that you can now create more posts that are applicable to all the major social networks. Hashtags are used on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p> The same promotional post can go out on each site. It would have great performance as the hashtags you are using would be popular on all of those sites.</p><p> But it is important to use some caution with using the same posts for all your social accounts. For instance, posts that are image or video-centric are better for Instagram, while posting links is more useful on Twitter and Facebook.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037359/7443" target="_top" id="2037359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037359/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Promote-Special-Events"><a href="#3-Promote-Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="3. Promote Special Events"></a>3. Promote Special Events</h3><p> When there is a special promotion, event or landmark associated with a business, using a hashtag for that occasion can be very helpful. A business that is having a sale, for example, could use a hashtag such as #discounts to indicate that fact. Anyone who is searching for that hashtag would see the post!</p><p> Hashtags are also useful for contests. While you cannot have someone enter a contest through a hashtag because of Facebook rules, it is helpful in letting more people know about the contest.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975562">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975562">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975562%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975562/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings"><a href="#Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings"></a>Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings</h2><p> Facebook has privacy settings that can be enabled on any personal or business account. And those privacy settings will impact hashtag post visibility.</p><p> When the settings do not let anyone else but your followers see your posts, even posts with a hashtag are not visible to non-followers. It will be important to adjust those settings to ensure that you have a wider reach with your posts that include hashtags.</p><p> For instance, you could choose a privacy setting where only <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/help/134343280099148?helpref=uf_permalink" >followers can see the posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or followers along with friends of followers. The second option gives you a little more reach, but still limits visibility.</p><p> When marketers are attempting to reach the widest possible audience, making posts public is the way to go. It will make non-hashtag posts public as well. But it ensures that any post with a hashtag has incredible reach.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151888/7443" target="_top" id="2151888">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151888" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151888/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Hashtags have become a crucial element of the Facebook experience. Someone who is searching for a product or service in the area, reading about a popular topic, or hoping to gather information on a news story will use hashtags. Marketers can use hashtags to ensure that any promotional campaigns, influencer marketing strategies or general posts are reaching a wider audience.</p><p> So hashtags are so important to Facebook.
