This creates a “Post Preview.” You can see what the post will look like when it goes live. Click on ‘Next’ on the bottom left of the screen to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-13.png"                      alt="fill in title on facebook live video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Simply fill out the live stream post details on the left side panel.

You can see the option to create ‘Live,’ ‘Event,’ ‘Jobs,’ and more underneath this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-9.png"                      alt="Create live for live broadcasts"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose ‘live video’ from that list of options. This will open a new page with two choices. You can choose to ‘Go Live.’ Alternatively, you can also choose to ‘Create live video events.’ Creating a live event gives your audience a chance to engage with you by responding to the event. Facebook also sends a reminder about the event before the schedule.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-10.png"                      alt="choose to go live or schedule an event"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can choose to ‘Go Live.’ This means you can simply go live for a casual update.

This page gives you many options on how to set up your stream. Look at the left-side panel options. You can choose which camera you want as your input source. Select the microphone you want to use on the page. Below the microphone icon is the button for ‘Start Screen Share.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-12.png"                      alt="share screen on facebook live"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you click on ‘Start Screen Share,’ a new dialog box pops open. It gives you the option of sharing’ Entire Screen.’, ‘Window,’ or ‘Chrome Tabs.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Under the ‘Entire Screen’ option, you can share the current window open as ‘Screen 1’. You can also share your desktop background if you choose. This shows up as ‘Screen 2’. Once you’ve made your choice, tap on the ‘Share’ button. This creates a “Post Preview.” You can see what the post will look like when it goes live. Click on ‘Next’ on the bottom left of the screen to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-13.png"                      alt="fill in title on facebook live video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Simply fill out the live stream post details on the left side panel. Fill out details like the live stream title in the ‘Title Required’ box. You can add additional descriptions in the prompt box beneath the title box. Click on ‘Next’ when you’re done filling in the details.</p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You’ll now see the Dashboard. Beneath the Dashboard, you can spot the ‘Go Live’ button. Once you’re happy with the live video setup, you can click on the ‘Go Live’ button. The live video is set up with a countdown from three to one. Your video then goes live.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-14.png"                      alt="go live using screen share on facebook"                ></p><p>One drawback to the Facebook live screen share function is that you can’t show your face. It cannot support screen sharing and a window with webcam settings simultaneously. You can get around this function by using a video editor like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It is a feature-rich video editor.

This will open a new page with two choices. You can choose to ‘Go Live.’ Alternatively, you can also choose to ‘Create live video events.’ Creating a live event gives your audience a chance to engage with you by responding to the event. Facebook also sends a reminder about the event before the schedule.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-10.png"                      alt="choose to go live or schedule an event"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can choose to ‘Go Live.’ This means you can simply go live for a casual update.

This page gives you many options on how to set up your stream. Look at the left-side panel options. You can choose which camera you want as your input source. Select the microphone you want to use on the page. Below the microphone icon is the button for ‘Start Screen Share.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-12.png"                      alt="share screen on facebook live"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you click on ‘Start Screen Share,’ a new dialog box pops open. It gives you the option of sharing’ Entire Screen.’, ‘Window,’ or ‘Chrome Tabs.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Under the ‘Entire Screen’ option, you can share the current window open as ‘Screen 1’. You can also share your desktop background if you choose. This shows up as ‘Screen 2’. Once you’ve made your choice, tap on the ‘Share’ button. This creates a “Post Preview.” You can see what the post will look like when it goes live. Click on ‘Next’ on the bottom left of the screen to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-13.png"                      alt="fill in title on facebook live video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Simply fill out the live stream post details on the left side panel. Fill out details like the live stream title in the ‘Title Required’ box. You can add additional descriptions in the prompt box beneath the title box. Click on ‘Next’ when you’re done filling in the details.</p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You’ll now see the Dashboard. Beneath the Dashboard, you can spot the ‘Go Live’ button. Once you’re happy with the live video setup, you can click on the ‘Go Live’ button. The live video is set up with a countdown from three to one. Your video then goes live.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-14.png"                      alt="go live using screen share on facebook"                ></p><p>One drawback to the Facebook live screen share function is that you can’t show your face. It cannot support screen sharing and a window with webcam settings simultaneously. You can get around this function by using a video editor like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It is a feature-rich video editor.

These procedures, if followed properly, can help users set up the platform and share the video of their choice across Facebook. Look into the steps provided to understand the procedure to <strong>embed Twitch stream on Facebook.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start, you are advised to install OBS Studio across your device. Access your browser and download the setup for sharing streams across Facebook. Tap on the “Download” tab on the top-right corner of the screen and proceed to select the operating system of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="click on download button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On selecting the appropriate OS, you will be redirected to a new window to download the setup across your device. Launch the installer and follow the installation procedure to install OBS Studio across your device successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="install the obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As OBS Studio successfully installs itself across your device, the user will be redirected across the Auto-Configuration Wizard for setting up the platform according to the desired options. The user can set up the settings according to streaming and recording screens. On the other hand, they can only look forward to optimizing options according to recording the screens. For connecting and configuring audio and video across OBS, set up the sources across the Auto-Configuration Wizard and proceed towards finalization.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> On configuring the settings, run OBS Studio and test the streaming services before <strong>stream Twitch to Facebook Live.</strong> It is impossible to perform cross-sharing across Twitch exact; thus, there is a need to configure an applet for Twitch and Facebook to help share the stream with Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="check your obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Get started by setting up the free IFTTT account. You can choose any of the sign-in methods to proceed across the platform. Pick Google or Facebook from the available options and finish the on-screen settings to link the Facebook account and Twitch for sharing videos across the platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-6.jpg"                      alt="login with google or facebook"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To set Facebook for the sharing content across the applet, the user will be directed to a new window where they are advised to provide their credentials. On completing the setup of the account, you need to provide IFTTT with permission to access your Facebook account. For this, tap on the “Continue as (Username)” option. IFTTT will get permission to share content and videos across the account from Twitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-7.jpg"                      alt="connect with facebook"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> On completing the log-in of Facebook, proceed to provide the credentials for Twitch to connect the platform with Facebook for sharing content. Enter the important credentials for Twitch across the applet and tap on the log-in button once done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-8.jpg"                      alt="login twitch account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Successfully connect the account with IFTTT and configure Twitch across Facebook to proceed successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-9.jpg"                      alt="connect twitch with fb"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> You need to initiate a stream for posting it across Facebook.

IFTTT will get permission to share content and videos across the account from Twitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-7.jpg"                      alt="connect with facebook"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> On completing the log-in of Facebook, proceed to provide the credentials for Twitch to connect the platform with Facebook for sharing content.

But how can you make sure that your Page is seen by as many people as possible? And how can you make sure that it appears at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs)?</p><p>Here are a few simple steps that you can take to improve your Facebook Page’s visibility and rank it higher in the SERPs.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-sure-your-Facebook-Page-is-properly-set-up"><a href="#Part-1-Make-sure-your-Facebook-Page-is-properly-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Next, take some time to fill out your profile completely, and include a compelling description of your business.</p><p>Then, start posting relevant, high-quality content on a regular basis. As your page becomes more popular, you’ll start to see an increase in your Facebook ranking.</p><p>By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your Facebook page is working hard for you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description"><a href="#Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Of course, you don’t want to stuff your title and description with keywords - that will just make your Page look spammy. Instead, focus on using a few key phrases that accurately describe what your Page is all about. And make sure that those phrases are prominently featured in both your title and description.</p><p>With a little keyword optimization, you can help ensure that your Facebook page ranks high in search results - and that more people see and engage with your content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms"><a href="#Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

And when it comes to Facebook, one of the best ways to get more exposure for your Page is to promote it on other social media platforms.</p><p>By sharing your Page on Twitter, Instagram, and other sites, you can reach a wider audience and encourage more people to like and follow your Page. Additionally, you can also use paid advertising on social media to target potential customers and get your Page in front of them.</p><p>When done correctly, promoting your Facebook Page on other social media platforms can be a great way to increase your ranking and get more visibility for your business.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Add-fresh-relevant-content-regularly"><a href="#Part-4-Add-fresh-relevant-content-regularly" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

A Facebook ad is a message that you pay to have displayed on other people’s Facebook pages.

Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience</strong></p><p>The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one’s appearance.</p><p><strong>#2. Introduce the Solution</strong></p><p>Once you’ve connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.</p><p><strong>#3. Call to Action</strong></p><p>The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.</p><p>For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like “Click here to learn more about our weight loss product.”</p><p><strong>Example of Facebook ads Creative Image</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/creative-facebook-ads-example.jpg"                      alt="creative facebook ads example"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three simple structures for creating a creative image for your Facebook Ads, it’s time to get started!

It had brought turbulence in the social media world back in 2004 which were embraced by everybody and it is carrying that charm until now! It is a social networking company registered under the name of ‘Facebook, Inc’ which allows its users to communicate with other people. These other people are also defined by users and can be their family, friends, coworkers or potential friends! Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook created this boon of social media in 2004 while he was enrolled at Harvard University with a vision of designing a media platform for college students. But nobody would have imagined its progress graph! By 2006 anyone over the age of 13 with a valid email address could join Facebook. So this social networking website which was supposed to allow users to create profile, share moments through uploading photos and videos and assisted in staying in touch with family and friends for a long time, transformed into one of the much sought after platforms with more than 1 billion users worldwide.</p><p> Facebook is available in 37 different languages which truly reflect its respect towards diversity and it also supports various translation applications if you want to improve existing translation. Being the largest social media network was probably not enough for Facebook and hence the three key public features of Facebook which it has launched are classified as follows:</p><p><strong>Marketplace:</strong> It allows you to discover, buy and sell items in your community. You can post and respond to all sorts of ads of your region.</p><p><strong>Groups:</strong> It allows members to coordinate with near and far friends having common interests. The definition of common interests is open ended, it can be a bachelor party, concert bucket list or project updates, Facebook group lets you communicate in searchable place.</p><p><strong>Events:</strong> These encourage boosting engagement, get people talking, and provide helpful information and links for an upcoming event and ultimately planning and tracking who plans to attend. 650+ million users make use of Facebook Events and 100 million on an average every day to publicize the event!</p><h2 id="Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know"><a href="#Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="Common Facebook Terms which you should know"></a>Common Facebook Terms which you should know</h2><p> If you haven’t joined Facebook until now and feel left out in the group of your friends when they discuss about liking and reacting to a post, updating status, hashtags and tagging then don’t worry! There are lots of terms and phrases which can be termed as ‘Language of Facebook’. These words were in dictionary earlier also but Facebook reinvented their purpose! Warning: They might seem confusing at first but once you enter this world, then these will become your prime words!</p><p><strong>Status Update:</strong> These are text based posts that can describe your mood, thoughts or anything which you want to share with your Facebook friends.</p><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> This is like a page dedicated to you (As good as your profile). You can share information including your pictures, basic information like your favorite books, entertainment shows, celebrity etc.</p><p><strong>News Feed:</strong> You can term it as combination of status and timeline of your friends. News Feed shows you updates from your friends and recent posts from the Facebook pages that you follow. This is where you spend your most of the time!</p><p><strong>Like:</strong> If you enjoyed and want to reach on the profiles of your friends then you choose to Like or Dislike the post.</p><p><strong>Tag:</strong> It is like marking your friends who hold relevance to the pictures or status that you are uploading on your timeline. These then appears on the timeline of your friends and in newsfeed of other friends.</p><p><strong>Notification:</strong> It is like an update from Facebook of the events and occasions where someone has interacted with you. It might be through reacting on what you shared or by posting something on your wall etc.</p><h2 id="Exploring-Facebook"><a href="#Exploring-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Exploring Facebook"></a>Exploring Facebook</h2><p> Facebook is user friendly and once you create your account, you will feel like exploring all its options and becoming familiar with its adorable features. Here is a quick guide to Homepage and timeline:</p><h4 id="The-homepage"><a href="#The-homepage" class="headerlink" title="The homepage"></a>The homepage</h4><p> As soon as sign in to your Facebook account, you would be redirected to the News Feed. It means your homepage consists of information and images which your friends have shared. It consists of Menu at the very left which contains quick hyperlinks to Events, fun apps and groups that you are part of.</p><p> On the top right, there is a panel which shows notifications, new friends requests and chat messages. This whole section is termed as recent activity panel.</p><p> On the very top you would see a blank space reading like ‘What’s on your mind?’ This is the publisher space where you can update status or add pictures and videos that you would like to share.</p><p> News Feed as we discussed above is what your friends are sharing for you to see. Right panel which read as trending Stories highlights the posts which other are reading and you can click on those hyperlinks for detailed story if you are interested in them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-homepage.jpg"                      alt=" facebook homepage "                ></p><h4 id="The-Timeline"><a href="#The-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="The Timeline"></a>The Timeline</h4><p> The Timeline which represents your profile and is visible to your friends and public (subject to your privacy settings) contains inventory of everything which you have shared and which people has tagged you. You can set your profile picture by simply browsing through your picture library. Profile picture is the one which your friends will see when you will comment anything on Facebook. Coverphoto is a picture which can be seen by anybody when they visit your timeline. You can set your personal picture or wallpaper also to express your personality and interests. You can make your profile more informative by adding your school, college, workplace, relationship status and your location etc.</p><p> In short, timeline shows everything which forms part of your profile and also the activities which your friends might have posted on your timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-timeline.jpg"                      alt=" facebook timeline"                ></p><h2 id="How-Facebook-usage-is-diversified"><a href="#How-Facebook-usage-is-diversified" class="headerlink" title="How Facebook usage is diversified?"></a>How Facebook usage is diversified?</h2><p> There are ample of ways to communicate and staying in touch such as emails, instant messaging or SMS but Facebook has dominated all of them except for professional workspace! Let’s check out what makes Facebook so unique and lovable that you feel like sharing the occasion and celebration with your circle in that very moment!</p><p> Things which you can do with Facebook are not limited to below:</p><ul><li>Allows you to login into different portals as websites have integrated Facebook for the login mechanism which means that with similar login credentials you can operate on different websites.</li><li>Provides a platform to connect with your idols and celebs</li><li>Gives you ample of space to share your thoughts and pictures to keep everybody updated</li><li>Chat unlimited with your online friends</li><li>Encourage your friends to join informative groups and events</li><li>Share your feelings for your friends and tag them to pictures which suit their personality</li><li>Play games and enhance your circle</li></ul><h2 id="How-Does-Facebook-Sharing-Work"><a href="#How-Does-Facebook-Sharing-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does Facebook Sharing Work?"></a>How Does Facebook Sharing Work?</h2><p> Facebook is unique and so are the sharing norms! While your conversations at email or IM’s are private, the content that you share on Facebook including photos and links are public. This is because Facebook has emerged as an open network for communication without any sort of limitations and is thus inclined towards being public although you can define privacy and sharing settings for some shared posts.</p><p> The privacy tools can be applied on few posts and information, the remaining information (such as your cover picture) is visible to everybody. Facebook is designed to be more open and social than traditional communication tools. You will learn more in this Facebook tutorial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><h2 id="What-is-Facebook-1"><a href="#What-is-Facebook-1" class="headerlink" title="What is Facebook"></a>What is Facebook</h2><p> Facebook has redefined the meaning of social networking.

It had brought turbulence in the social media world back in 2004 which were embraced by everybody and it is carrying that charm until now! It is a social networking company registered under the name of ‘Facebook, Inc’ which allows its users to communicate with other people. These other people are also defined by users and can be their family, friends, coworkers or potential friends! Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook created this boon of social media in 2004 while he was enrolled at Harvard University with a vision of designing a media platform for college students. But nobody would have imagined its progress graph! By 2006 anyone over the age of 13 with a valid email address could join Facebook. So this social networking website which was supposed to allow users to create profile, share moments through uploading photos and videos and assisted in staying in touch with family and friends for a long time, transformed into one of the much sought after platforms with more than 1 billion users worldwide.</p><p> Facebook is available in 37 different languages which truly reflect its respect towards diversity and it also supports various translation applications if you want to improve existing translation. Being the largest social media network was probably not enough for Facebook and hence the three key public features of Facebook which it has launched are classified as follows:</p><p><strong>Marketplace:</strong> It allows you to discover, buy and sell items in your community. You can post and respond to all sorts of ads of your region.</p><p><strong>Groups:</strong> It allows members to coordinate with near and far friends having common interests. The definition of common interests is open ended, it can be a bachelor party, concert bucket list or project updates, Facebook group lets you communicate in searchable place.</p><p><strong>Events:</strong> These encourage boosting engagement, get people talking, and provide helpful information and links for an upcoming event and ultimately planning and tracking who plans to attend. 650+ million users make use of Facebook Events and 100 million on an average every day to publicize the event!</p><h2 id="Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know-2"><a href="#Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know-2" class="headerlink" title="Common Facebook Terms which you should know"></a>Common Facebook Terms which you should know</h2><p> If you haven’t joined Facebook until now and feel left out in the group of your friends when they discuss about liking and reacting to a post, updating status, hashtags and tagging then don’t worry!

Warning: They might seem confusing at first but once you enter this world, then these will become your prime words!</p><p><strong>Status Update:</strong> These are text based posts that can describe your mood, thoughts or anything which you want to share with your Facebook friends.</p><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> This is like a page dedicated to you (As good as your profile).
