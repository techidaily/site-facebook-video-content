Well! We have just said about the thumbnail on your Facebook video. The social media video you upload on Facebook will garner more viewership with a suitable and attractive thumbnail.

When there is a weak internet connection, the videos on Facebook might not auto-play; they would display a static image there. Don’t exceed the 90 characters Ad copy limit for the thumbnail, in case your video has text on it. Try to keep it as less as you can to adhere to Facebook’s 20% text policy.

### 10\. Add call to action

Adding a call to action in your video is vital. Without a call to action, viewers might watch and forget a video and the message you are conveying will be lost.

You need to build the base, ask them to like, share, or comment on your Facebook videos or even push them gently to visit your website, check out the products/service. You can add a link using goo.gl or bit.ly to cut-short the link and guide them for more information about your services.
