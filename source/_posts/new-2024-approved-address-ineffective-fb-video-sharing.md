### Method 4: Clearing the Cache

The presence of cache in the Facebook app is one of the most concerning root causes of this problem. Hence, one should keep on clearing the cache periodically. To clear the cache, the steps include:

**Step 1:** In this first step, hold your Android device and click on "Settings." Choose "Apps" from the diverse menu options. After that, tap on "Manage Apps."

**Step 2:** Search for "Facebook" and open it. Navigate to the "Storage" from there. The system shows the app's total size, user data, and cache.
