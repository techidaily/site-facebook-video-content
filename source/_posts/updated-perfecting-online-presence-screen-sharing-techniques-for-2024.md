**Step 2:** Choose 'live video' from that list of options. This will open a new page with two choices. You can choose to 'Go Live.' Alternatively, you can also choose to 'Create live video events.' Creating a live event gives your audience a chance to engage with you by responding to the event. Facebook also sends a reminder about the event before the schedule.

**Step 3:** You can choose to 'Go Live.' This means you can simply go live for a casual update. It comes with the ability to add interactivity tools for your Facebook audience. You can preview how your live stream is going to look. This is done by using the 'Create a test broadcast before going live' button. Toggle it on and click on 'Select.'
