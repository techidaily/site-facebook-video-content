### 6\. Q/As with Fans

If you come across any video where some artist has done a Question and Answer with their fans, then this kind of video is also useful for music Pages to monetize.

### 7\. Day in Life – Tour Videos

Artists usually share their daily routines. They make videos of how they spend a day of their life. Along with that, they mostly give a Home or Studio tour to their followers and fans. All such videos can also be monetized.

The update of Facebook now allows content creators to monetize their content. With this update, more users and content creators can earn money from their videos, live streams, etc., whereas according to an old version, videos that were 3 minutes long were only monetized.
