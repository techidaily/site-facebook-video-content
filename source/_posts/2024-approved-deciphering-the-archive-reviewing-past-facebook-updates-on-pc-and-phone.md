Facebook business pages help in enhancing business significantly, primarily if you use story features for customer interaction. If you want to keep track of old stories, you can use the following method:

**Step 1: Go to your Page**

Open your page and click on **publishing tools** in the menu given in the top bar.

**Step 2: Click on the story archive**

On the top left, you will see a **story archive** option; click on it.

**Step 3: View story**

When you click on the story **archive**, you will see all your old stories in sequential order; click to view.

**Conclusion**

Facebook is an excellent platform to interact with your audience, and the story is one of the best features to give your friends a glimpse of your life. Going through old stories can refresh a lot of our memories. If you did not know how to see old stories on Facebook, now you do.
