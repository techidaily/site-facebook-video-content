## Part 1: Why you should choose square videos

Do you have any idea about when should you go square for Facebook videos? These videos occupy around [78% extra space of the mobile feed or News feed](https://www.adweek.com/digital/instagrams-box-shaped-videos-are-influencing-facebook-marketers-172490/)than landscape ones which makes it an ultimate choice for Instagram and Facebook videos.

According to the social media management application Buffer, [square videos and letterbox videos (1:1) format scored better](https://blog.bufferapp.com/square-video-vs-landscape-video) in recent ads over social media accounts. The average views, engagements, and completion rate on mobile devices yielded the said result.

You need to opt for square videos, while creating a video for social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter. For mobile phone viewers, square videos on Facebook will engross more space and be prominently visible.

## Part 2: What you should consider when you create a video

[Here are the aspects](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video/facebook-feed/video-views) that you need to keep in mind, while creating square videos on Facebook. Avoid black bars/letter or pillar boxing and upload a high resolution video of at least  compression, square pixels, with progressive scan, fixed frame rate and 128+ kbps stereo audio compression.

Here are the facts and figures –

* 9:16 to 16:9 video ratio.
* High resolution video with appropriate ratio and size constraints.
* Minimum 1 second to maximum 240 minutes long video.
* Maximum 4GB file size.
* 125 characters text
* Vertical videos having 2:3 aspect ratio which might be masked to 2:3.

If the video has links, a 25 characters’ link and 30 characters’ link description is what you need. If you post 360 videos, the aspect ratio tolerance needs to be 3%.
