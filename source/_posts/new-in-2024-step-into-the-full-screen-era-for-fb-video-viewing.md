### For PC Users

If you are a Chrome user on Windows, follow the three methods designed for you.

**Method 1: Clearing the Browsing Data and Cache**

The first fix to make Facebook video run in full screen revolves around clearing the browsing data and cache. There are no strings attached to this method. The process is as simple as it can get. The steps include:

Step 1: For starters, open your Chrome browser and click on three vertical dots located in the top right corner. Click on "Settings" from the context menu that appears.

**Method 2: Disabling Browser Extensions**

The browser extensions are often added to work effectively. But they do not work all the time and create problems for the normal workability of the Facebook app. Disabling the browser extensions is the right way to clear the **FB full-screen problem.** The steps are:

Step 1: Launch your Chrome browser and head to the three dots. Click on "Settings" and then head-to-head to the "Extensions" from "Main Tools."
