### Method 3: Switching the Auto-Updates Off

Most apps' performance is hindered by the new update installed by the user. It may contain a bug or a virus, so it is crucial to turn off the auto-updates and stay ahead of the issue.

**Step 1:** The first and foremost step is to open the Play Store and navigate to the "Facebook" app from Apps and Games. You can also launch it by typing "Facebook" in the search box.

**Step 2:** From the top right corner, tap on the three vertical dot icons and untick the "Enable Auto-Update" option.

### Method 4: Clearing the Cache

The presence of cache in the Facebook app is one of the most concerning root causes of this problem. Hence, one should keep on clearing the cache periodically. To clear the cache, the steps include:

**Step 1:** In this first step, hold your Android device and click on "Settings." Choose "Apps" from the diverse menu options. After that, tap on "Manage Apps."

**Step 2:** Search for "Facebook" and open it. Navigate to the "Storage" from there. The system shows the app's total size, user data, and cache.
