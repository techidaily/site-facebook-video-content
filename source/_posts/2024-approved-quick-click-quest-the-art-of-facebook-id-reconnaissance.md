![search is back facebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-is-back-interest.jpg)

**Note**: If there are no results on the redirected Facebook page, you must get back to the Search is Back page and change your search filters to start a new round of search.

Like Find People tab at the top of the page, you may also search events, posts, shares and photos from the event, post & shares, and photos tabs at the top of the page.

## Conclusion

In the fast-paced world, where people are constantly running, it has become very difficult to keep in touch with anyone. Facebook not only helps you to connect with people but also find many old connections that lost at some point of time due to the hectic schedule that people are into or shift of place or for any other reasons. Searching for people is not easy on Facebook but if you know the right ways to search, then you surely can find the right person.

To find your friends by their location, you may enter your friend‚Äôs hometown city‚Äôs name in the hometown field to search them by the place when they earlier lived in. To find your school friends or High school and university friends, you may enter the schools‚Äô name and search for them.

Once you find your old friends, click on the ‚Äúadd friends‚Äù button beside their name and the person is added to your official list of friends on Facebook.
