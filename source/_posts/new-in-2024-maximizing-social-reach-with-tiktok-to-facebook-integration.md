## Part 1: Social Media Integration

The Social Media Industry has grown exponentially with a new app every few years or so. But, TikTok has introduced a new trend that was unheard of before. The content creation angle of it all has empowered everyone to show their skills to the world and entertain all the users on every platform.

What makes social media so powerful is the integration. Users are on so many different apps that it feels like an entirely different virtual universe. To cope with all that, Influencers need to create impactful content that reaches the maximum number of people.

An excellent way to do that is social media integration. A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers. For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren't on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.

If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.

## Part 2: How Can You Share Tik Tok Videos to Facebook on iPhone or iPad?

## Part 1: Social Media Integration

The Social Media Industry has grown exponentially with a new app every few years or so. But, TikTok has introduced a new trend that was unheard of before. The content creation angle of it all has empowered everyone to show their skills to the world and entertain all the users on every platform.

What makes social media so powerful is the integration. Users are on so many different apps that it feels like an entirely different virtual universe. To cope with all that, Influencers need to create impactful content that reaches the maximum number of people.

An excellent way to do that is social media integration. A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers. For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren't on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.

If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.

For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren't on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.

If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.

## Part 2: How Can You Share Tik Tok Videos to Facebook on iPhone or iPad?

If you are an Apple user, you will most likely have a very different method to share your TikTok videos than Android users. To ensure that you can share your videos seamlessly and quickly, we have listed all the steps below. So, Let’s begin:

**1\. Open TikTok:**

Tap on the TikTok app on your iPhone or iPad to open it.

![Open TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-1.jpg)

**2\. Select the Video:**

Now, in the next step, you need to select the video you want to share. You can share any video from the discover page, newsfeed, and a user’s profile.

**3\. Share The Video:**

Click on the video to start playing it. Once the video is playing, you will spot a small white arrow on the right side. Click on the arrow to share the TikTok video to Facebook.

**4\. Select Facebook from the share options:**

Now, the iPhone will give you options for the apps you want to share the video with. Tap on Facebook to share the video to Facebook.

Once you tap on the Facebook icon, you will be prompted to open Facebook if you are sharing from TikTok to Facebook for the first time. Click on Open to continue.

The Facebook App will now open, and your selected TikTok video will be shown on the new post screen.

**5\. Select where you want to post:**

At the top of the screen, you will see the words “Your Timeline”. Tap on it to change where you want to post the video. You can choose to post it in a group, a friend’s timeline, or Facebook newsfeed.

In case you are also managing a page, you can also post the video there by selecting your page. This will post the video on the page’s timeline.

**6\. Add a caption for your video:**

To add a caption to your post, tap on the "Say something about this" box and write whatever you like. You can also add your location, add emojis or customize your post before posting.

**7\. Tap the Share :**

Now tap on the Share button on the top right corner to share the video with your friends.

An important point to note here is that if you have chosen the destination as your timeline, you will be prompted to select if you want to post the TikTok to your Facebook story or Facebook Newsfeed. Select the option you want and then click on Share Now.

## Part 3: How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark

While sometimes you might share videos from TikTok to Facebook, other times you might want to post the same video on Facebook without linking it back to your TikTok account. This is especially useful if you are going to post the same video on your Facebook and Instagram accounts.

However, this can be a bit tricky with the TikTok watermark over the video. But, do not worry, we have got you covered. We will guide you in detail on how to remove a watermark from a video and then share it to your Facebook account. Let’s dive right in:

### To Remove Watermark from Tiktok Videos on iPhone and Android

Most software these days only allow you to remove watermarks in their premium versions, where you might have to pay some extra bucks to avail that feature. But Apowersoft Recorder allows you to do that for free.

The software is extremely easy to use, and you can remove any text, logos, or unnecessary objects from your video. You can save the video from TikTok without the logo and username on it. Just follow the simple steps below to remove watermarks from your video.

1\. Download the [ApowerREC](https://www.apowersoft.com/record-all-screen)app on your phone and launch it.

2\. Tap on the settings icon in the button on the right corner of your screen.

![Tap on the settings icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-4.jpg)

3\. Make sure you have turned on the Recording Overlay and Screenshot overlay. This will help you to record and take a screenshot of the video simultaneously.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Turned on the Recording Overlay ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-5.jpg)

4\. By default, TikTok videos are in a vertical format, so you would need to set the recording in the portrait style.
