### Captivating and Engaging Videos

The Facebook videos have to be captivating so that the viewers' do not get bored. Once they scroll down, you have lost it. Engage the audience in the first three seconds by asking a relevant question or using a title card.

### Make it Soundless

Most Facebook users have their sound muted. Therefore, find a way to communicate yourself without depending upon sound. Use animations, texts, and effects to bind the audience to the screen.

### Brief Yet Complete

The video must be brief for 7 seconds, but it should convey a complete and comprehensive message. It shouldn't end abruptly without a powerful and thoughtful end. Design the video that sends a profound message in only 7 seconds.

### Entertainment with Motivation

Use instructional videos or cooking tutorials that entertain the audience. You can start from an uplifting and motivational video so that the audience gets a mixture of both fun and inspiring.
