### Method 3: Switching the Auto-Updates Off

Most apps' performance is hindered by the new update installed by the user. It may contain a bug or a virus, so it is crucial to turn off the auto-updates and stay ahead of the issue.

**Step 1:** The first and foremost step is to open the Play Store and navigate to the "Facebook" app from Apps and Games. You can also launch it by typing "Facebook" in the search box.

**Step 2:** From the top right corner, tap on the three vertical dot icons and untick the "Enable Auto-Update" option.
