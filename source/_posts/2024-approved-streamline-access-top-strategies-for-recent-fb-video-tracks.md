### What to Do If I Can't View or Play Videos on Facebook?

One of the most common problems with Facebook is when you want to watch a video but cannot do so. This could occur due to a bad internet connection or technical glitches. The best way to fix these issues is by following the below steps:

* **Check If You Have Strong Internet Connection:**

If you have a slow/dull internet connection there are chances that your video isn't playing due to the same. In that case, you can check for a slow connection by opening some other application. If it shows the same issues, switch to a stronger internet connection. Make sure to connect to strong WiFi or cellular data.

* **Go for a Quick Application Restart:**

Sometimes a quick restart can ensure a swift Facebook video play. So, close the Facebook application on your device and relaunch it. Alternatively, check if there are any recent updates available for the app. If you see any, update the app accordingly.

### How to Delete Watch History on Facebook?
