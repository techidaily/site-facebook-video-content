**Step 3:** As OBS Studio successfully installs itself across your device, the user will be redirected across the Auto-Configuration Wizard for setting up the platform according to the desired options. The user can set up the settings according to streaming and recording screens. On the other hand, they can only look forward to optimizing options according to recording the screens. For connecting and configuring audio and video across OBS, set up the sources across the Auto-Configuration Wizard and proceed towards finalization.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 4:** On configuring the settings, run OBS Studio and test the streaming services before **stream Twitch to Facebook Live.** It is impossible to perform cross-sharing across Twitch exact; thus, there is a need to configure an applet for Twitch and Facebook to help share the stream with Facebook.

![check your obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitch-stream-on-facebook-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Get started by setting up the free IFTTT account. You can choose any of the sign-in methods to proceed across the platform.
