**Reason 4: You’ve not updated the software of your device.**

Much like an outdated application, it’s important to update the software or operating system of your smartphone, PC, or laptop. An outdated app may not support advanced features like a Facebook video icon. So, update the software of your device asap.

**Reason 5: Your phone’s screen or display is too small to see the icon.**

No tv icon on Facebook video could be because the tiny display of your device hides many icons and features. So, you may need to scroll down and up a lot if this is the case.

**Reason 6:** Finally, in order to see the Facebook video icon, you may have to disable another icon in the shortcut bar. Once you’ve done this, only then can you add this icon back on it.

These are the most common reasons when you see Facebook video icon missing. Fortunately, you can fix most of these problems yourself because these are not major ones.

But in some cases, for example, when you don’t know Facebook settings, you’ve to go for alternative solutions.
