* Note that, each caption phrase need to be divided into several numbered sections so start with 1 and then press Enter.
* The standard timing options for SubRip formats use to be milliseconds so you need to divide all phrases respectively into desired time slots. Keep on adding your phrases till the time you cover whole video.

* Now save this text file into SRT format by using Save and then All Files option. Add your desired file name and select file format as .srt. Hit Save option.
* Note: Facebook can't recognize your caption file unless it is named in the format: \[two-letter language code\]\_\[two-letter contury code\].srt.

#### Generate Captions

For this case, all you need to do is select the Generate option from tool and captions will be automatically added in US English language format.
