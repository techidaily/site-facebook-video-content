Since macOS does not support applications, you will have to use the dedicated Safari Browser or another third-party browser and open Facebook Messenger.

**Step 2: Log in**

Log in to your Facebook account using your credentials and open the chat that has the video you wish to save.

**Step 3: Select the Desired Option**

Right-click on the video and choose “Save to Facebook” if you want to add it to your online collection or click on Download video to save it on your Mac.

## Download Facebook Messenger Videos on Web Browser

Sometimes, the in-built download option is unavailable in some updates or under some circumstances, or the video is not directly from the sender's phone. You may need some tricks on your web browser to do the job.

Following are the steps to do so.
