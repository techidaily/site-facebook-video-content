## Part 4: 5 Tips for Making Facebook Slideshow

After you know how to make slideshow in 3 different ways, here we will let you know 5 tips for making a photo slideshow on Facebook. You can make slideshow now, but if you want to make high quality video slideshow, these tips are necessary and easy to follow and understand.

### 1\. Make sure to use 3-10 images

If your have only 2 images, the slideshow are too short to let people know your brand or product. Let's say you have 10 images and one second per image. Then you can get a 10-second slideshow. 10 seconds are enough to [grab people's attention](https://animoto.com/blog/photography/hook-video-viewers-5-seconds/). However, you need to make sure the first 3 seconds are high quality images that people want to continue watching. It is best to add music to make it engaging.

### 2\. Choose the right Facebook slideshow format

It is suggested to use mov and mp4 video format. These 2 formats are compatible well on different devices and the file size won't too large. If you upload Facebook slideshow on other formats, the final file might be too heavy. As a result, the video slideshow will be slower when it is playing.

Most importantly, you can add transitions to make slideshow look natural. If you are good at editing, you also can correct color or make color grading.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Make sure to use 3-10 images

If your have only 2 images, the slideshow are too short to let people know your brand or product. Let's say you have 10 images and one second per image. Then you can get a 10-second slideshow. 10 seconds are enough to [grab people's attention](https://animoto.com/blog/photography/hook-video-viewers-5-seconds/). However, you need to make sure the first 3 seconds are high quality images that people want to continue watching. It is best to add music to make it engaging.

### 2\. Choose the right Facebook slideshow format

It is suggested to use mov and mp4 video format. These 2 formats are compatible well on different devices and the file size won't too large. If you upload Facebook slideshow on other formats, the final file might be too heavy. As a result, the video slideshow will be slower when it is playing.

![Facebook slideshow format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora-business/Facebook-slideshow-format.jpg)

### 3\. Edit your Facebook slideshow

The slideshow will be boring if you only add images to combine it. It is suggested to [add text/title to make your key message appear](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Most importantly, you can add transitions to make slideshow look natural. If you are good at editing, you also can correct color or make color grading.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Don't add too many CTAs

We know that you want to do more conversions and get more sales, but if you add CTA on each imgaes, it is a mistake. People will close your slideshow video. [You need to add CTAs wisely](https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/seven-principles-for-video-ctas).

### 5\. Rememeber to make test

You won't know which version is better if you don't make A/B test. You can run 2 ads in one campaign to see which ad is better. You need to make sure the budget, bid and landing page are the same of the 2 ads. After the test is over, analyze it and choose the best one for you.

## Part 4: 5 Tips for Making Facebook Slideshow

After you know how to make slideshow in 3 different ways, here we will let you know 5 tips for making a photo slideshow on Facebook. You can make slideshow now, but if you want to make high quality video slideshow, these tips are necessary and easy to follow and understand.

### 1\. Make sure to use 3-10 images

If your have only 2 images, the slideshow are too short to let people know your brand or product. Let's say you have 10 images and one second per image. Then you can get a 10-second slideshow. 10 seconds are enough to [grab people's attention](https://animoto.com/blog/photography/hook-video-viewers-5-seconds/). However, you need to make sure the first 3 seconds are high quality images that people want to continue watching. It is best to add music to make it engaging.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Choose the right Facebook slideshow format

It is suggested to use mov and mp4 video format. These 2 formats are compatible well on different devices and the file size won't too large. If you upload Facebook slideshow on other formats, the final file might be too heavy. As a result, the video slideshow will be slower when it is playing.

![Facebook slideshow format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora-business/Facebook-slideshow-format.jpg)

### 3\. Edit your Facebook slideshow

The slideshow will be boring if you only add images to combine it. It is suggested to [add text/title to make your key message appear](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Most importantly, you can add transitions to make slideshow look natural. If you are good at editing, you also can correct color or make color grading.

### 4\. Don't add too many CTAs

We know that you want to do more conversions and get more sales, but if you add CTA on each imgaes, it is a mistake. People will close your slideshow video. [You need to add CTAs wisely](https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/seven-principles-for-video-ctas).

## Part 4: 5 Tips for Making Facebook Slideshow

After you know how to make slideshow in 3 different ways, here we will let you know 5 tips for making a photo slideshow on Facebook. You can make slideshow now, but if you want to make high quality video slideshow, these tips are necessary and easy to follow and understand.

### 1\. Make sure to use 3-10 images

If your have only 2 images, the slideshow are too short to let people know your brand or product. Let's say you have 10 images and one second per image. Then you can get a 10-second slideshow. 10 seconds are enough to [grab people's attention](https://animoto.com/blog/photography/hook-video-viewers-5-seconds/). However, you need to make sure the first 3 seconds are high quality images that people want to continue watching. It is best to add music to make it engaging.

### 2\. Choose the right Facebook slideshow format

It is suggested to use mov and mp4 video format. These 2 formats are compatible well on different devices and the file size won't too large. If you upload Facebook slideshow on other formats, the final file might be too heavy. As a result, the video slideshow will be slower when it is playing.

### 3\. Edit your Facebook slideshow

The slideshow will be boring if you only add images to combine it. It is suggested to [add text/title to make your key message appear](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Most importantly, you can add transitions to make slideshow look natural. If you are good at editing, you also can correct color or make color grading.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Don't add too many CTAs

We know that you want to do more conversions and get more sales, but if you add CTA on each imgaes, it is a mistake. People will close your slideshow video. [You need to add CTAs wisely](https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/seven-principles-for-video-ctas).

### 5\. Rememeber to make test

You won't know which version is better if you don't make A/B test. You can run 2 ads in one campaign to see which ad is better. You need to make sure the budget, bid and landing page are the same of the 2 ads. After the test is over, analyze it and choose the best one for you.
