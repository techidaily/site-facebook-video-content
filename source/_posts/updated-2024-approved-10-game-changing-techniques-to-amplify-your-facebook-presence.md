### 1. Optimize Facebook Content

 Speaking of SEO for Facebook page, though, it might not have a direct impact on social media content and popup results for your keyword search on Google. You need to mention the social media platform name in Google search to get the results. Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you [optimize social media content using keywords](https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide).

### 2. Optimize Page URL

Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.

### 3. Optimize company profile

When you add phone numbers and address on your business page, Google gives more credibility to your page. As a result, your brand’s overall SEO will be enhanced.
