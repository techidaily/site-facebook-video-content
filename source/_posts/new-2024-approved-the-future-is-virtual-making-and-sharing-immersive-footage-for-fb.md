## What is 360 Degree Video?

 Most of the cameras these days are capable enough to capture shoots with 170 degree wide coverage and in case if you want to show the scene behind the camera then it becomes essential to use two 170 degree FOV cameras back to back. Hence, for capturing all six directions in a single footage you may require connecting 6 cameras together while adjusting their focus in different directions. The resultant content is known as 360 degree video. Many smart algorithms have been developed by professionals to get these videos stitched together to develop complete 360 degree content in a single footage. This is something like standing in the centre of a sphere and viewing everything in all directions.

 These 360 degree videos have inspired the concept of virtual reality but these equipments are quite expensive. But as soon as the technology is gaining popularity, chances are to get VR gear at lower price in near future.

 So, now you may be thinking hard that how this feature is useful for Facebook users. Actually, Facebook has recently enabled its users to upload 360 videos directly to their pages, groups or profiles so that audience can stay engaged. This is really interesting.
