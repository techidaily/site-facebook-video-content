While covering the quality of the stream, the users have to look into several other elements which are equally important to allure viewers into looking across the stream.

Thumbnails provide an idea to the viewers on the genre of the live stream that the content creator is featuring. This is why it is considered important across any live stream. Before setting up a thumbnail, there are certain limitations provided by Facebook for the streamers. The platform allows uploading JPEG or PNG as a thumbnail across the video. Along with that, it needs to be less than 3MB in size.

Users who wish to add a thumbnail across their stream must follow the steps explained below.

**Step 1:** You need to direct yourself into the Creator Studio to go through the settings of your stream. Lead to the "Creative Tools" section from the left-hand panel and select "Set Up Live Stream" from the window featured on the front.
