 Note: It needs to be noted here that you will be able to zoom in and zoom out the timeline so as to view all the clips in the timeline with clarity. In case the duration of the video is lengthy then you can alter the duration of the still photos or cut some of the clips from the video footage. In order to use other effects like overlays and filters you just need to depend on Filmora.

#### 3\. Saving your video to the device

 Once you are done with the editing of your footage you need to hit the Export button for output. Since the Facebook profile video can only be uploaded through an iOS or Android smartphone, you will be required to select the Device in the left panel of the Export Window and then choose your device.

![export output](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-output.jpg)

 Note: Remember that the export isn’t going to transfer the videos to your mobile device directly. The video is going to be stored in the local hard disk.

## Section 2: Uploading the Profile Video to Facebook

 Now that you have created a stunning profile video with the help of the Wondershare Filmora software, it’ time for you to upload it on Facebook. You can upload up to 7 seconds of video footage for your Facebook Profile Video. The profile video is going to appear in the place of your profile picture and everybody will be able to view it.
