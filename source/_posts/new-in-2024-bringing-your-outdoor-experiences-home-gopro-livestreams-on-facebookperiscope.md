[The Live4 App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/live4-live-stream-gopro-iphone/id919921242?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)\-would allow you to broadcast the action sports videos from your GoPro or iPhone.
[The Periscope App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/periscope-live-video-streaming-around-the-world/id972909677?mt=8)\-would allow you to broadcast and view what’s happening around the globe through live clips.

Once you have downloaded these 3 apps you will be required to go to your GoPro app and connect it to your action camera.
