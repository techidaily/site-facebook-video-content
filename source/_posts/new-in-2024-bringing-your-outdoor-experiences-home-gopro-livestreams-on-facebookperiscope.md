[The Live4 App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/live4-live-stream-gopro-iphone/id919921242?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)\-would allow you to broadcast the action sports videos from your GoPro or iPhone.
[The Periscope App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/periscope-live-video-streaming-around-the-world/id972909677?mt=8)\-would allow you to broadcast and view what’s happening around the globe through live clips.

Once you have downloaded these 3 apps you will be required to go to your GoPro app and connect it to your action camera.

**Note:**

1\. Never exit the Periscope app while you are broadcasting or it will end the broadcast
2\. Swiping right during the broadcast will let you choose the camera from which you want to broadcast. When you double tap the broadcast screen you will be allowed to toggle between your action camera and the iPhone camera.

## Conclusion

Live streaming your GoPro footage would allow you to share your action moments with your friends and followers at any given time. GoPro cameras are known to capture videos like no other cameras can. Live streaming your action camera footage will let your share those extreme moments no matter where you are.
