## How to Create Subtitles and Captions for Facebook Video

Here are a few simple steps to get things done:

Step 1: First of all, you need to move to your video library. In case if you find this library is empty, then you can add videos to it from your personal device. Simply use the upload button to get your video to which you wish to add subtitles or captions.

If you want to add captions from SRT file then simply use Upload SRT file option available on screen and get it uploaded from your computer. And then click the Save button.

SRT caption files are usually supported by almost all popular media players and they can be generated by users with the help of standard text editor tools like Notepad++ or MAC OS users can switch to TextEdit option. Follow the steps below to get started:

* Simple open your desired Text editor tool.
* Note that, each caption phrase need to be divided into several numbered sections so start with 1 and then press Enter.
* The standard timing options for SubRip formats use to be milliseconds so you need to divide all phrases respectively into desired time slots. Keep on adding your phrases till the time you cover whole video.
