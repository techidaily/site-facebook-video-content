## Part 2: How to Pin Music and Songs to Facebook Profile?

There’s another feature that Facebook allows you to use, and that’s pinning songs. When you pin a song, it will be added to your profile. You can pin one song at a time, though. To do that, follow the steps below:

**Step 1:** Go to your Facebook page and log in using your Facebook credentials. Please remember that this feature is only available for smartphones and iPad.

**Step 2:** Go to your profile page and locate the Music tab.

![Facebook Profile Music Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the Music option. Each song will have three dots; click on that, and then you will see the option Pin to Profile. Click on that, and the song will be pinned to your profile.

## Part 4: How to Remove Unwanted Music from Facebook Profile?

Just like you can add songs to your profile, you can easily remove them as well. For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:

**Step 1:** Go to your Facebook profile page and not the feed page. On your profile, scroll down a bit and click on the Music icon.

**Step 2:** Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.

**Step 3:** From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.

![delete Facebook Profile Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-music-track-from-facebook-profile.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Remove Unwanted Music from Facebook Profile?

Just like you can add songs to your profile, you can easily remove them as well. For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:

**Step 2:** Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.

**Step 3:** From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.

**Step 2:** Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.

**Step 3:** From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.
