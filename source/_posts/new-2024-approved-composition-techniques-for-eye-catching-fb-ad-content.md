### Tips to Improve the Quality of Facebook Video Ads

Not everyone can create Facebook video ads that have some quality or that attract every viewer. For such conditions, we are here to help you. Given below are the tips and tricks that will contribute to making better Facebook video ads.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Video Formatting

The most important tip when it comes to Facebook ads videos is the formatting. We always forget the crucial fact that this is a multi-device era. Every person uses at least 2 devices. So, while you make Facebook video ads, make sure that the video is in both portraits and in the landscape too. You should give your viewer a full-screen view on whatsoever device they prefer.

### 2\. Keep Things Interesting

Attracting viewers is easy as compared to sustaining their interest in your content and your brand. For that, the best suggestion is to keep things interesting for them. You can create Facebook video ads by implementing different styles. You can sometimes add BTS (Behind the Scenes) to your video. Making some kind of tutorial or recording an informative video can also do the job in a better way.

### 3\. Add Caption

It has been observed and noticed that 85% of the audience watch videos on Facebook with sound off. For such scenarios, you must add captions to your content. This way, even if the sound is off, your message will be conveyed to the viewer. Even if the sound is off, you can still promote your brand.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Video Length

While you are planning to create Facebook video ads, you should not ignore the element of video length. Not every person sits and listens to complete video ads. It's best to make small and concise video ads, yet they should be informative. You must convey your message and promote your brand early in the video so that no one misses or ignores it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Content Quality

For your Facebook ads video, you should maintain the quality of the content. Although it is mentioned to take care of the video length yet, the video must cover the essentials for the brand and the product. An ad video that lacks sharing basic information about the brand is nearly useless. A good Facebook video ad must have a conversion, consideration, and lastly, awareness.
