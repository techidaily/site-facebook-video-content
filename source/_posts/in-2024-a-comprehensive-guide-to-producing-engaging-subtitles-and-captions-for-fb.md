But this feature is not yet added to Facebook Profiles, reason being the Facebook pages and profiles use follow large number of feature based differences. If you love to stream videos so often on Facebook Pages then probably you must be searching hard for the caption and subtitle creation option as it allows easy customization. Don’t worry! The article below can provide you complete information to add captions on your Facebook videos:

## How to Create Subtitles and Captions for Facebook Video
