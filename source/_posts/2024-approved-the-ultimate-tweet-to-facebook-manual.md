Fortunately, you can set your Twitter account and sync it with Facebook to kill two birds with a single stone. You can post Tweets to Facebook automatically as updates, sparing your personal intervention. Automatic posting of Tweets on Facebook ensures your friends on both platforms get your updates without the extra work.

## How to Post Tweets to Facebook – Step by Step guide

 Let's learn how to use Twitter with Facebook and be able to post Tweets to Facebook –

 First and foremost, you need to connect your Twitter account with your Facebook, so that the posts on Twitter gets synced and posted on Facebook.

1. Login to your Twitter account on your desktop, which you want to link with your Facebook profile.

2. Now, from the dropdown list shown to you, click ‘Settings and privacy' and then open the ‘Apps' tab from the left panel.
