### For Mobile Devices

If you want to customize the suggested videos section on your mobile, then it is very simple. We suggest you follow the steps given below, and you will easily customize the videos.

**Step 1:** The first and basic step for this customization is opening Facebook on your mobile device. Then, locate the ‘Watch’ option from the Facebook shortcut bar.

**Step 2:** In the watch section, you are supposed to head over to your favorite video. You will see three-horizontal dots on top of every video; click on that. Upon clicking, a drop-down menu will show up on the screen.
