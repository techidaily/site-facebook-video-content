Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you [optimize social media content using keywords](https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide). Links and public posts using those keywords will show up on the search results.

 People click and engage with your content if it’s relevant to them and included in the keywords, and spend more time on your site.

### 2. Optimize Page URL

 For Facebook SEO, you need to have a [custom URL same as your brand name](https://www.weebly.com/seo/url). It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL.
