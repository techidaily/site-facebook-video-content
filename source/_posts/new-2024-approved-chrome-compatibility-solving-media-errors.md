People log in to Facebook to get entertained and enjoy their free time. When they run into **Facebook videos not playing in Chrome,** their stress levels enhance. Follow the procedure below to get rid of this concern if you use Facebook from your computer.

![use different internet broswer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-not-playing-11.jpg)

### Method 2: Ensure a Working Internet Connection

**Facebook videos not playing 2020** occur due to an unstable internet connection. There are multiple devices connected to one router that reduces the speed. Ensure that you are connected to an active internet connection and offer workable speed.
