### How to Make Split-Screen Videos?

Those who are interested to create a surprising stunning video clip for their Facebook friends are advised to use Filmora [Split Screen Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . This application is compatible with Mac as well as Windows platform and follows a user-friendly interface.

Get it installed and launch on your platform. As soon as the software gets started on your system, simply make selections for the desired aspect ratio for your project.

#### Step 2. Import Video

There are two options to import video files to Wondershare Timeline. You can either access them by pressing the Import button from the timeline that helps to bring files directly to the User’s Album. Or the second option is the user-friendly ‘drag and drop’ tools that make everything easier for a beginner.

#### Step 3. Select Split Screen Preset

![split screen in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-in-filmora.jpg)

You will find the Split Screen button on Wondershare Toolbar. Select this option and it will soon lead you to the library containing numbers of split-screen formats. Out of this big list, you can choose anyone and then drag it to a timeline. If you don’t want to use drag and drop tool then select your present, right-click over it, and then from the drop-down menu select the Apply option. One more option is to choose your present type and then hit the Plus icon available on the lower right portion of the thumbnail.

#### Step 4. Add videos to Split Screen

Go to the timeline and double click on your recently selected preset. You will find drop zones on your timeline to which videos can be added.

![split screen drop zone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-drop-zone.jpg)

#### Step 5. Video Sound Adjustment

Now as you have added all videos to your split screen, they will naturally start playing at the same time and their audio information will appear like noise.

### How to Make Split-Screen Videos?

Those who are interested to create a surprising stunning video clip for their Facebook friends are advised to use Filmora [Split Screen Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . This application is compatible with Mac as well as Windows platform and follows a user-friendly interface. It offers a wide range of video editing features and results can be customized using transitions or by adding background music effects. The resulting video files can be directly uploaded to Facebook with the desired file format. You will be glad to know that Wondershare Filmora extends support to more than 150 media file formats along with high-resolution video content.

Here are simple steps for creating split-screen videos:

#### Step 1. Download Wondershare Filmora

First of all, you need to go online and download Filmora [Split Screen Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from its official website. Get it installed and launch on your platform. As soon as the software gets started on your system, simply make selections for the desired aspect ratio for your project. Now from the welcome window, make a selection for full feature mode.

#### Step 2. Import Video

There are two options to import video files to Wondershare Timeline. You can either access them by pressing the Import button from the timeline that helps to bring files directly to the User’s Album. Or the second option is the user-friendly ‘drag and drop’ tools that make everything easier for a beginner.

#### Step 3. Select Split Screen Preset

![split screen in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-in-filmora.jpg)

You will find the Split Screen button on Wondershare Toolbar. Select this option and it will soon lead you to the library containing numbers of split-screen formats. Out of this big list, you can choose anyone and then drag it to a timeline. If you don’t want to use drag and drop tool then select your present, right-click over it, and then from the drop-down menu select the Apply option. One more option is to choose your present type and then hit the Plus icon available on the lower right portion of the thumbnail.

#### Step 4. Add videos to Split Screen

Go to the timeline and double click on your recently selected preset. You will find drop zones on your timeline to which videos can be added. Simply drag your video files and drop them in different drop zones as the available one box contains a slider for time adjustments of various videos, users can access it to apply desired timing constraints. One can also add borders to videos from the “Apply Border” option and the best part is that the colors of these borders can be also customized to create unique effects.

![split screen drop zone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-drop-zone.jpg)

#### Step 5. Video Sound Adjustment

Now as you have added all videos to your split screen, they will naturally start playing at the same time and their audio information will appear like noise. Here you need to apply some trick for sound adjustment so that viewers do not find your content annoying. The best advice is to mute one video at a time and let another play normally. In order to mute a video file, you can simply hit the Mute Track option from Drop Zone. Users can also mute both these videos and add one separate informative file in form of a soundtrack to the split-screen video. You can find such soundtrack files in the built-in media library of Wondershare. Once all soundtrack adjustments are done then hit the OK button to save the changes.

![mute split screen video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-split-screen-video.jpg)
