## Part 4: Add Thumbnail to Facebook 1080p Stream

People who consider to **stream 1080p Facebook** for designing creative content have to ensure the consistency of every element that is involved in the stream. While covering the quality of the stream, the users have to look into several other elements which are equally important to allure viewers into looking across the stream.

Thumbnails provide an idea to the viewers on the genre of the live stream that the content creator is featuring. This is why it is considered important across any live stream. Before setting up a thumbnail, there are certain limitations provided by Facebook for the streamers. The platform allows uploading JPEG or PNG as a thumbnail across the video.
