In this section of the article, we will highlight the various reasons why Facebook suggested videos are not showing up.

### 1\. Improper Launching

One resulting factor that might cause your **Facebook suggested videos not to show up** is the improper launch of the application. Sometimes improper launch hinders your way and blocks the view of suggested videos.

You should always try to treat the problem on time. You are suggested to follow the given solutions for this particular problem because you never know what might work for you. First of all, you should log out from Facebook, and you can also delete the browser completely. After that, you should install it fresh. You should also restart your system. Then give it some time to work properly.

### 2\. Poor Network Signals

A very common reason observed for **FB suggested videos not showing up** is the weak connection. This is the most accurate reason for many Facebook problems. Not just this issue but with poor network signals, you might also face some other troubles.

The best thing to tackle this problem is selecting a good and strong connection environment. With this solution, you can avoid many other problems as well, including this problem. With a stronger network connection, refresh the page because it increases the chance to view the videos.

### 3\. Insufficient Space

As we mentioned earlier, there is a complete section of random entertaining videos. It consists of hundreds of videos that it has to buffer at once. Facebook videos need buffering to get played, and for that, they require quite the space.

If you don't have sufficient space, this might be the resulting factor for **Facebook suggested videos not showing up.** This is the reason that causes the delay in loading the videos on time.

For this scenario, the suggested solution is to stop Facebook forcefully. Once that is done, now it’s time to clear and empty the cache for applications' better performance.
