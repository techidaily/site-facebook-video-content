## Part 5: How to Solve "Facebook Story Upload Failed" on iPhone?

The section allows the iPhone users to help them with the "**Facebook story upload failed"** issue. The article has designed four extensive solutions to address the problem. Let us have a glance!

### Fix 1: Reviewing the Internet Connection
