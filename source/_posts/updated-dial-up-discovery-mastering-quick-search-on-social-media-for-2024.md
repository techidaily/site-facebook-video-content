**Note**: If there are no results on the redirected Facebook page, you must get back to the Search is Back page and change your search filters to start a new round of search.

Like Find People tab at the top of the page, you may also search events, posts, shares and photos from the event, post & shares, and photos tabs at the top of the page.

## Conclusion

Facebook not only helps you to connect with people but also find many old connections that lost at some point of time due to the hectic schedule that people are into or shift of place or for any other reasons. Searching for people is not easy on Facebook but if you know the right ways to search, then you surely can find the right person.

### Step 4: Friends Search

On the top right of old friends search, you can find the ‚Äúsearch for your friends‚Äù filters. To search your old friends by name, you have to enter their part or full names in the name field and look for them. To find your friends by their location, you may enter your friend‚Äôs hometown city‚Äôs name in the hometown field to search them by the place when they earlier lived in. To find your school friends or High school and university friends, you may enter the schools‚Äô name and search for them. For searching your old colleagues, you may enter the company or employer‚Äôs name and find people who worked in the same organization.

### Step 5: Check the results

On the left panel, you can find several names matching your search filter. You just need to scroll and check the displayed list to see if any of your old friends are there in the list. Once you find your old friends, click on the ‚Äúadd friends‚Äù button beside their name and the person is added to your official list of friends on Facebook.
