**Step 2:** You will be taken to the feed page directly upon login in. You need to click on the profile picture that you can see on the top right.

Now that Facebook allows you to add a song to your profile, feel free to express yourself better because you never know who you might inspire just by adding a relatable song to your profile, right. Moreover, you can choose a song according to your mood and add it to your profile to reflect on your current feeling.
