### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If youâ€™ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure theyâ€™re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If youâ€™re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Donâ€™t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isnâ€™t engaged theyâ€™re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewerâ€™s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, thatâ€™s success!

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If youâ€™ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure theyâ€™re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If youâ€™re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Donâ€™t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isnâ€™t engaged theyâ€™re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewerâ€™s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, thatâ€™s success!

### Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?

As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:

* Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%
* Facebook video get, on average, over [8 billion daily views](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/)
* Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer
* Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate

No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!

This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad wonâ€™t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client.

Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.

You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. Youâ€™ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad wonâ€™t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once youâ€™ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.

#### 2. Choosing A Format

Once youâ€™ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad. You have a few specific options to choose from:

* Carousel
* Single Image or Video
* Collection group for Fullscreen Mobile Experience

Note: if youâ€™ve enabled the Dynamic Creative option under Conversion in Ad Set tab, youâ€™ll see the Single Image or Video format option only, since the Dynamic Creative allows you to upload individual images and headlines and generate combination automatically. Here, weâ€™ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps. Once youâ€™ve got the hang of it, you can experiment with the other two.

#### 3\.  Adding Your Media & Elements

Click Add Image and a window will open for you to select images - you can choose from the images on your account, your particular Facebook page youâ€™re creating the ad for, your Instagram, or upload stock images.

#### 4\.  Creating Your Video with Templates

Once youâ€™ve browsed through them and decided which is best for you, click on **Customize** at the bottom of the window.

#### 5\. Customizing Your Video Creation Kit Template

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If youâ€™ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure theyâ€™re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If youâ€™re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Donâ€™t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isnâ€™t engaged theyâ€™re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewerâ€™s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, thatâ€™s success!

### Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?

As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:

* Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%
* Facebook video get, on average, over [8 billion daily views](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/)
* Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer
* Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate

No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!

### What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?

Whatever the purpose of your video, youâ€™ll find the Facebook Video Creation Kit to be quite useful for you. You can create your ad using video footage, or simply add some photos for a slideshow effect.

This is great for **promoting products and services, introducing new businesses or ideas, or simply sharing something cool** that youâ€™ve created with your friends. Not only does it showcase your photos or products, youâ€™ll be able to add your **own text, links**, and **info to promote** your stuff exactly the way you want to!
