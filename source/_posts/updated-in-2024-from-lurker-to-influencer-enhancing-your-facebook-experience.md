## Part 1: How to Schedule a Facebook Live?

Scheduling a live video is where you plan a live stream on a particular time slot. Keep note that live video scheduling is only possible through a PC. You will also have to use the Google Chrome web browser for the same. Now that you know the pre-requisites, let's comprehend the process in detail.

* To schedule a live video, click on the "What's on your mind?" option. It's situated just above the News Feed.
* Following that, click on the Live video option.
* Now, click on the "Schedule live video event" option. It's present in the left column.
* Within the left column, choose the location where you want to stream your live video. You will get options like timeline, page, or group. If you want to upload a live video on your timeline, select the same. Likewise, for a group or page, select the options accordingly.
* Assign a name to the event. Also, choose other details like the date and time for your live streaming. After that, select the privacy setting for your live stream.
* Click on Next. To add pictures to your live video announcement, click on "Upload Cover Photo" or "Choose illustration". Likewise, a default image will be selected if you do not want a special picture as your cover photo.
* Once done, click on the Create Event button. This is present on the bottom side of the left corner. Your live stream will be scheduled.

Once you schedule a live video, two posts will be generated automatically. This includes an announcement post and the live video post. The announcement post features all the information of the upcoming live stream. On the other hand, the live video post ensures that a live post is shared as per the scheduled date and time.
