### Method 2: Ensure a Working Internet Connection

### Method 3: Disable Hardware Acceleration

Browsers use hardware acceleration to bring the perfect user experience for videos preview. However, it doesn't work all the time, so disabling it feels like the right choice.

### Method 5: Update the Browser to the Latest Version

The Facebook videos stop playing due to the outdated browsers. The users are always recommended to log in to Facebook with a browser that is up to date. Download the latest version of your browser in use and steer clear of **Facebook video not playing continuously.**
