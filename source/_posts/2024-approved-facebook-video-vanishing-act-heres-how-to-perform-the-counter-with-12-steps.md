## Part 4: How to Make My Posted Videos Show up on Chrome?

It is important to pay attention to **why can't I see my uploaded videos on Facebook** via Chrome? The article presents four effortless methods to help with **FB videos not showing up.**

### Solution 1: Altering the Video Format

Facebook supports MP4 and MOV formats for your videos. Therefore, it is recommended to convert your video format to MP4 or MOV. Wondershare UniConverter offers great help for this process. Follow the guidelines below to start the video conversion process.

**Step 1:** Launch Wondershare UniConverter from your system and click on "Converter" from the left panel. Add the targeted video file by clicking on "Add Files."

### Solution 2: Clear Browsing Data

Clearing the browsing data and cache always acts like the workable solution to your **posted video Facebook not showing up** problem. Such data is prone to corruption and hinders the normal functionality of your browser. The process is as given below:

**Step 1:** Open the browser and click on three dots from the top left corner of the interface. Click on "Settings" from there. Navigate to "Privacy and Security" afterward.

**Step 2:** Tap on "Clear Browsing Data" and set the time range. You can choose to clear the data from all times, since a week or an hour before. Tick mark on all options to get rid of cache.

![tap on clear browsing data](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/posted-facebook-videos-not-showing-up-8.jpg)

**Step 3:** Tap on "Clear Data" once you have made the settings.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Solution 3: Disable Browser Extensions

The browser extensions also interfere with how Facebook operates. Therefore, it is always a good idea to disable the extensions. The steps are as follows:

**Step 1:** From your browser, tap on the "Options" and click on "Settings." Navigate to the "Extensions" tab from the side menu.

### Solution 4: Changing the Browser

The different browsers offer unique traits to the users. If Chrome continues to act up and maintains the **FB videos not showing up** concern, consider changing the browser. You can use Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

![use different internet browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/posted-facebook-videos-not-showing-up-12.jpg)
