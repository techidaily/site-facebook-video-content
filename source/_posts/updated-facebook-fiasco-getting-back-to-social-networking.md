Never reply to messages which are unknown or click on links or watch doubtful videos. The links can automatically take you to dangerous sites. For example, the Facebook messenger hack video prompts you to open the video and leads to malicious websites.

If your friend asks for any personal information, their account may have been hacked, so stay alert and avoid sharing sensitive data through Facebook messenger.
