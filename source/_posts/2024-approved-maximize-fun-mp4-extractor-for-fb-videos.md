The convenience and speed are two major reasons to download this Facebook video downloader in mp4\. Another could be that it offers a clean and user-friendly interface.

One benefit of using snap downloader is its built-in web browser that lets users download private videos, playlists, and content that generally need you to be logged in.

What better way to expedite the video download capabilities than with the "One-Click Mode." This mode allows you to save your videos in your preferred format and output as a premium feature. All it needs is to input the link in the open text field.
