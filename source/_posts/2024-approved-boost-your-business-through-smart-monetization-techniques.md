### Pay-per-view structure and Facebook payment structure

**Your earnings = (Ad CPM x ad views)/1,000**

Sharing your page with your friends is one way. To get your posts shared, curate content that you and your target audience will enjoy. The key to maintaining a following is regular engagement with your posts once you've built one. Every industry requires frequent engagement to grow a following.
