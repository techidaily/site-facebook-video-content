## Part 1: Copyright – Explaining All Important Dynamics to this Legal Right

We have heard people saying, “**Facebook removed my video due to copyright.**” By jurisdiction of the digital community and international laws, copyright is known as a legal right that protects the original authority over the content and information developed. Any work that has been designed, developed, or created by a user has copyright over it once it has been created and deployed.

![what is facebook copyright policy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-copyright-1.jpg)

Talking about what copyright covers in its ambits, a variety of work is catered across this terminology. Any visual or audiovisual work, audio content, and literary work created by users have designated copyrights of the user responsible for its creation. The basic eligibility criteria for such content is to be original to fit the cross-fits of copyright.

This requires the content to have a minimum percentage of creativity that would cater to its plausibility to have copyright over it. However, names, slogans, and titles do not come with the possibility of having copyrights over them.

### How to Know The Content Can Have Copyrights?

Until now, many would question how they can have the idea of the content to own **Facebook video copyright**? To answer this question, it is better to go through a few situations that would explain how a user can assess their content to have copyright. Considering you appear in a video or photo, it necessarily does not provide you the copyrights over it.

On the other hand, anything that you or a client has potentially created provides you with certain copyrights over it. It explains that users can simply understand their position over how original their content is to be called copyright material.

### Rights as Copyright Owner

Being an owner of some content, you can practice certain rights to protect and secure your content from being used on other platforms without your consent. The rights are discussed as follows, providing an understanding of how they can protect their content.

* Stopping from copying and distributing the work.
* Creating new works based on your work.

Copyright infringement, the term recognized over the breach of copyright, occurs when people utilize the copyrighted work without the owner's permission.

* Refrain from using bought or downloaded content from websites, such as iTunes.
* Content that has been recorded across personal recording devices.
* Try to give credit to the owner of the content.
* Add a disclaimer that would clear the intention of using copyright content or infringing it.
* Do not intend to profit from the content.
* Try to add original content in major proportion across your content.
* Do not think that the posted content is of fair use.

While covering these points mentioned above, you should also be vocal in getting permission to use the work of another owner across your design. With an idea over these points, you are quite sure how and what to post across Facebook. While covering all the points discussed above, it can avoid copyright infringement across the content.

## Conclusion

The copyright claim is an important part of the content made across the ambits of originality. Users work across their designs, documents, or models, which requires particular protection. While surviving across platforms such as Facebook, the tool ensures that the content posted across the platform is out of the boundaries of **Facebook video copyright** infringement. Facebook has kept a no-tolerance policy for such cases and advises users to follow a set of options that would help them prevent such problems in the future.
