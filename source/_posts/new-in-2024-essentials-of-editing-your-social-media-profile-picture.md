**Step 2:** Now click the “Choose from My Photos” option to select a cover photo for your profile. This method can help you to select photos from your already uploaded Facebook photos.

**Step 3:** You can choose your cover photo from your favorite album that is always available on the Facebook platform.

Once you have updated your desired photo then you can soon view it from the timeline but it will be containing one message over it: “Drag to reposition cover”. In case if your cover is not of standard size then you will have to adjust its dimensions on Facebook. Note that Facebook covers need to be wider enough to meet its dimensions, the minimum requirement of the cover photo is 720 pixels wide.

**Step 4:** It is time to drag your cover photo with the simple-to-use auto drag tool of Facebook. Try to adjust your cover photo perfectly within the standard frame size.

**Step 5:** Now you can save changes:

**Note:** In case if you are not satisfied with the quality or content of your recently updated Facebook cover photo, you can try to update another one with the same procedure as discussed above.

It is also possible to select photos from any folder inside your computer or smartphone. When you choose to select from your computer then it will immediately open up a new navigation window on your screen and you will be able to see all files through it. Simply follow the instructions displayed on-screen to select your photo.

As soon as you have changed your cover photo with any of these methods as discussed above, it will soon appear in your timeline posts. In case if you want to remove it from the news feed, you can also make settings to remove the cover page change notification from the timeline. On the right-hand corner of your cover, you will find a pencil-like icon, click this one to hide your cover notification from the page.
