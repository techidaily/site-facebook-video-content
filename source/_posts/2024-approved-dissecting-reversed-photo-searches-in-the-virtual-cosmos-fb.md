#### 3\. Reverse Image Search Facebook using Google Images

Google is known for its search engine but most people are unaware of the feature of reverse image search of Google. It allows you to find the source of the images, information about the images and much more related to a particular image. We can use Google to have a reverse image search Facebook as well.

**Step 01:** Navigate to images.google.com

**Step 02:** Hit on the "Camera" icon beside the search box. Now click on Search by Google. It will provide you with two options for reverse image search, upload the image or paste the URL of the image. If you have the image saved on your device, then upload it on Google.

If the Facebook profile that contains the image doesn't have any restrictions, you can see the Facebook profile in the search results. It will show you all the related websites and pages that contain the same image. It will lead to the profile that contains the image you have searched for.

#### Conclusion

All of the above methods can help you have a reverse image search Facebook for any purpose you want. Choose any of the methods that are more convenient and easier for you to apply. You can try all of these three methods and see which one works best for you.
