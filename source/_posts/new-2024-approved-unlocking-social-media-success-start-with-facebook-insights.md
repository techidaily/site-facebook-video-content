### 2\. Page Likes

 There are three basic metrics in the likes section.

 Firstly, the **page likes**, which captures the total likes on your page per day for 28 days.

 Secondly, the **net likes**, which captures the total new likes on your page subtracted by the total dislikes.

 Finally, the **certain times** your page was liked but broken by where it took place. In order to build your brand, you need to keep a track of your page likes and make sure that you are targeting the right people and connecting with them by targeting posts through relevant content.

### 3\. Post Reach

 The Post Reach helps you to understand how many people viewed your posts and how they interacted or responded to it. It is divided into 4 prime metrics. The Post Reach shows you the number of people who were exposed to a particular post. It is further broken into paid and organic reach.

**Total Reach** shows the total number of people who viewed any kind of activities from your page.

 In Like Comments, and Share section, you can check the total number of shares, comments, and likes and the positive engagement your page received. Your post will be shown to more people according to the higher number of engagement in your post.

 In Hide, Report as Spam, and Unlikes, you may check the negative people count on your page. When the negative engagement of the people is more, lesser people can view your post in future.

By clicking on the Boost a Post, the Insights gives you the list of your high performing posts as well as the recommended posts with more user engagement. These posts can be promoted as per your choice. Your target audience, duration, and the budget of the promotion can be specified as per your choice.

### 5\. Video Analytics

 Now, the video tab gives you a complete overview of how your videos are performing. You can check out the paid and organic, repeat and unique, and manual click and auto click views on your videos. There are 3 tabs under this section.

 Video views show the number of times your video is viewed and more than 3 seconds is considered a view by Facebook.

 You may check out how many times the people viewed your video for more than 10 seconds under the 10-Second Views tab.
