Just like you can add songs to your profile, you can easily remove them as well. For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step guide to doing that:

**Step 2:** Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.

**Step 3:** From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.
