## Part 1 Types of Facebook Video Aspect Ratios

When you talk about videos, Facebook always recommends to upload videos with square (1:1) or vertical (9:16, 4:5, and 16:9) aspect ratios. As a result, it increases the compatibility on mobile and desktop screens.

Facebook also suggests you upload short videos (15 seconds or less) and design videos that work both without and with sound. It would be best if you enable the captions. For the best results, choose the following specifications for videos:

### 1\. Facebook Feed Videos

![Facebook Feed Videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/fb-aspect-ratio-1.jpg)

**●** Minimum Width: 120 px

**●** Minimum Height: 120 px

**●** Resolution: at least 1080 x 1080 px

**●** Video Ratio: 4:5

**●** Video File Size: 4GB max

**●** Minimum Video Length: 1 second

**●** Maximum Video Length: 241 minutes

For video ads, Facebook suggests you to upload the video with the highest resolution source available without pillar or letter boxing. Facebook gives the aspect ratios list and provides features available for every type of ad.
