Here are two ways to search people on Facebook. The second option also helps you to learn a new way to search for people. Let’s explore.

There are many people who connect with their family and friends on Facebook. It is [one of the most popular and largest social platforms on the web](https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/). Facebook is checked by millions of people each and every day that makes it incredibly a powerful tool for searching your lost contacts.

Whether high school chums, family, friends, family or old colleagues at any location, Facebook can search for people instantly. However, Facebook is limited when you need to input your friend’s exact name to find them.

Here are two ways to search people on Facebook. The second option also helps you to learn a new way to search for people. Let’s explore.

* [**Part 1: How to search people on Facebook**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How to search people using Search Is Back**](#part2)

### Step 4: Friends Search

On the top right of old friends search, you can find the “search for your friends” filters. To search your old friends by name, you have to enter their part or full names in the name field and look for them. To find your friends by their location, you may enter your friend’s hometown city’s name in the hometown field to search them by the place when they earlier lived in. To find your school friends or High school and university friends, you may enter the schools’ name and search for them. For searching your old colleagues, you may enter the company or employer’s name and find people who worked in the same organization.
