**Note:** In case if you are not satisfied with the quality or content of your recently updated Facebook cover photo, you can try to update another one with the same procedure as discussed above.

It is also possible to select photos from any folder inside your computer or smartphone. When you choose to select from your computer then it will immediately open up a new navigation window on your screen and you will be able to see all files through it. Simply follow the instructions displayed on-screen to select your photo.

As soon as you have changed your cover photo with any of these methods as discussed above, it will soon appear in your timeline posts. In case if you want to remove it from the news feed, you can also make settings to remove the cover page change notification from the timeline. On the right-hand corner of your cover, you will find a pencil-like icon, click this one to hide your cover notification from the page.
