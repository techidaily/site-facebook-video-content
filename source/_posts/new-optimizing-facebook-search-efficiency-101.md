To find your school friends or High school and university friends, you may enter the schools’ name and search for them. For searching your old colleagues, you may enter the company or employer’s name and find people who worked in the same organization.

Once you find your old friends, click on the “add friends” button beside their name and the person is added to your official list of friends on Facebook.
