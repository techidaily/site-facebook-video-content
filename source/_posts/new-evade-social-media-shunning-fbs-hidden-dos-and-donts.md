## What is Facebook Jail?

Facebook Jail is a term that is widely used when the site blocks your ability to post or comment on the content already posted. This block can be temporary and can also be permanent. It can lead to account termination as well.

There are several reasons for which the site blocks pages or profiles to post the content. If you are getting too many likes too fast, posting inappropriate content or breaking any rule then remember that you are doomed. Under such circumstances, the user comes to know via email that the features have been disabled.

With Facebook Jail you can be blocked for:

* A few hours
* 3 Days
* 6 Days
* A week
* It can be permanent as well.

It all depends upon the type of offense that has been committed. Getting out of the Facebook jail is in your own hands. You can avoid the situation fully if you read this article till the end.

## Top 10 Ways to Avoid Facebook Jail

Below are the top ways that can be applied to make sure that the best outcome is generated in this regard.

![how to get out of facebook jail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-jail-1.jpg)

#### 1. Don’t Spam Even if Your Post is Legit

It is important to understand that no site likes spamming. The same behavior is adopted by Facebook as the sheriff is always out to ensure that the site is safe for all. Even if your post is legit try to increase the time interval between posts.

If you post the same content over several groups or pages then you can land into issues. Facebook will block your account for future use. You might also end up being terminated permanently just in case the message was widely spread.

#### 2. Plagiarism is Your Enemy

It is a fact that plagiarism is your enemy. If you just post the link to the content and don’t spam it, it is just fine. If you are copying the entire content you will land into issues.

The same applies to the images that have been used in your posts. Certain images are on Google Images and have been marked as spam. Using such images will result in penalization and ultimate Facebook jail which will hamper your productivity.

It is advice from the content creators that work for Facebook that always use original content to avoid misadventure.

Here, I recommend Wondershare Filmora to create original yet interesting videos on Facebook effortlessly. With Filmora Template Mode, it is easier than ever to edit your Facebook videos because the AI-powered tool will edit the videos automatically.

#### 3. Avoid Being Anon and Tag Carefully

Don’t be anonymous with your friends as it can result in issues. If you are being anonymous for no reason and to top it all tagging your “Friends” then you can land in trouble. Real people are the best ones you should always use your real friend to tag into a post.

Honesty is the best policy and Facebook likes it as well. Tagging random people can get your account blocked permanently. It is one of the best ways on the topic of how to get out of Facebook jail with ease.

Add people to your group if you know them and only tag them with your real and personal profile. The element of trust is very important and will benefit you a lot in the long run.

#### 4. Use the Site properly

How do you know if you are in Facebook jail? The simple answer to this is the fact that you are not using the site properly. Get to know how the website works and how can you benefit from the features of the site.

Too much knowledge is dangerous and the same happens with the people as they start manipulating the algorithm of the site. Always remember that the people that are sitting in the management of Facebook are smarter than you are. You will not only get banned but if the offense is done repetitively then you might be kicked out permanently.

#### 5. One Facebook Account for One Person

It is important to note that for life you can have only one Facebook account. The algorithm has been defined in such a way that the links between the accounts are also explored by the bots. If Facebook gets to know the link between two of your accounts then you are done.

Some people get a ban as they create a profile for personal use and the business profile is also used for the same purpose. If this happens the Facebook will block you from posting from any of your accounts. In all such cases, the content is blocked and the person is Facebook jailed.

#### 6. Don’t Act Weird

Believe it or not but this can also lead to your account suspension. For instance, if you are sending friend requests to people you don't know then it is obvious that you will get jail for it i.e. the one on Facebook. Don’t send multiple requests at the same time as it can also make the site feel that you are a spammer.

The other issue is that people use private messaging to promote their business. It should never be done as it can lead to issues and troubles. Even don’t ever advertise your business on the pages of other businesses.

![facebook jail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/out-of-facebook-jail.jpg)

#### 7. Beware of Dirty Play

Beware of the people that can get your page marked as spam. This is done on a large scale just to harm your reputation. The first thing that you would notice is a constant spamming of your posts in the form of trolls.

In case any such behavior is observed then such accounts must be banned from your page. Also, report the individual accounts by marking them as spam. Perform this action ASAP so that you remain out of trouble.

Last but not least; reach out to customer support. Once they get to know this you are in the safe zone. Many links can be used to get the information as profiles and the pages get attacked all day every day.

#### 8. Comment and Like but be Cautious

It is another important factor that should be considered to avoid Facebook Timeout. Liking and commenting on pages at a fast pace is the main reason. If this is the case the Facebook algorithm will consider you like a spam bot.

Such bots are developed to mimic human behavior. You just need to control your pace and don’t have to be too quick as it can get you into the Facebook jail for no reason. Traffic information is an asset to Facebook and this is done just to maintain the balance.

#### 9. Avoid Information Overload

The information that you share on your profile or page must be very much balanced. It is a simple phenomenon and the business models should be developed in the same manner. Sharing every bit of detail is neither recommended nor does Facebook like it.

If you are running a business page then it is important that you only post 5 – 6 times a day. Telling customers everything on Facebook is not likable and at times the customers also get frustrated by getting constant notifications. Such users won't hesitate to mark your page as spam and get you into trouble.

#### 10. Be as Accessible as Possible

Your consumers must contact you easily. Providing adequate info on your page is the only way to do so. It is something that Facebook likes and the info presented should be permanent.

Permanent info shows that you are here to stay and are the owner of a legit business. The information section of your page should reflect instantly who you are and what the page is about. This will also help you in generating leads and get more new users regularly.

## How to Find Out If You Are in Facebook Jail?

![what is facebook jail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-jail-2.jpg)

It is too simple and there is no need for any sort of software or installation for this. If you have screwed something up as soon as you log in you will get to know. If you are in a current Facebook session and get jailed you will not be able to like the next post you see.

As compared to the past the Facebook policies have become stern with time. Getting jailed means that you have violated the terms and conditions of the website usage. In such a situation, you just need to read through this guide.

Facebook jail is easy to break but only if you employ the right strategy. Take a look at your profile to know the reason and the pages you manage. If everything fails then it is advised to turn to the Facebook community for help and contact their support to find a way out.

## Why Are You in Facebook Jail?

There are several reasons for which you have been Facebook jailed. Some most important reasons are mentioned as under:

* If you have been posting nude and provocative content then you will get banned. Facebook has a very stern policy against such content.
* If you hate a group then keep it to yourself. There must not be any hate speech, threats, or attacks on any person or group on Facebook.
* Spamming is like getting your Facebook account closed with your hand. Don't do it or else you will regret it.
* Never think that you have a large fan following and you can manipulate the Facebook algorithm. Regardless of the fan base, you will get banned instantly.
* Real you are liked by Facebook. Imposter you are spam and therefore will ultimately get blocked for posting a fake update and plagiarized content.
* There can be any term or condition that has been violated by the subscriber that can lead to the issue.

![what is facebook jail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-jail-3.jpg)

Also, you must take care of the following points so that you never get into trouble or in Facebook Time out Mode:

**Read the Terms of Service**

It is important to read the [terms of service of Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php). Before you start a page on Facebook just read through the Facebook terms of service so that you never get into trouble. Reading and understanding are important instead of thinking that getting out of Facebook jail-free card will do the trick.

**Suspicious Payments**

Register your real credit card for Facebook ads. It should be yours and must be in your possession all the time. Facebook does not like fraud and doing it with the site will get you banned instantly. Also, any payments that have been made through such cards will be reversed and you will face the penalty.

No site likes stolen cards to be registered with them and Facebook has all the right to put you in jail if this happens.

## How Long Facebook Jail Does Last?

It is never advised to breach the rules of the website. It is something that is unacceptable and you will get into trouble sooner rather than later. Don't ever go for the like services no manner how much they have spoken highly of their services.

Getting fake likes is one of the things that could get you into trouble.

First thing first your account cannot get blocked for more than 21 days. If you are still unable to post after the said period then you have been executed. The Facebook block can be classified into 3 categories:

* **The Highest Level**

It is the complete suspension of the account. It means that you are gone and done. There is no way to get the account back and the content as well.

In such a case, if anyone visits your page he will either be redirected to the main page or there would be a 404 error.

* **The Middle Level**

In such a case, certain features of your account are permanently suspended. Your account is not blocked but the features are forever disabled. For instance, you can post content to your timeline but cannot like the content on a friend's timeline.

There are other features that are also suspended in such cases. It includes Facebook ads, the marketplace, and group access. Depending upon the circumstances you might also not be able to access Facebook-based subscriptions as well.

* **The Lowest Level**

This level expires once the timeline mentioned by Facebook passes. The same features will be disabled which is done in the middle level but the ban is temporary. There is also a feature that allows you to file an appeal and this ban could get lifted even before the maturity date.

## How to Come out of Facebook Jail if You Get Blocked?

When it comes to the lowest level there is pretty much what can be done. You can file an appeal for a Facebook review. Once it is done you will get an email about the outcome of your appeal.

Either the website will accept or reject it. There have been many cases where people have won the appeals and the site has restored their functionality.

As for the other two levels which are higher there is nothing that you could do. The simple thing is to not waste your energy and get going with a new page or even an account. In a nutshell, you can get out of the lowest level of penalty but for the other two levels, the chances are slim to none.

Getting out of the Facebook jail is not a play and therefore should not be taken easily. The best part is that there is a bit of control which you can enjoy when it comes to this subject. It means that on the lowest level you can enjoy limited control in the form of appeal.

**Facebook Jail Meme**

Facebook jail meme can be regarded as a type of protest against the block by the website. Though these are just memes there are pages on Facebook those post such pictures. These pages just make it a fun-filled activity and the memes can also be downloaded and saved for future use.

Other than the Facebook pages many websites offer such content. You can download the images and post them to your Facebook account. This is a light fun-filled activity and you will enjoy it a lot.

Below are some websites that can be used to download such memes:

* [ballmemes.com](https://ballmemes.com/t/facebook-jail-meme)

## What is Facebook Jail?

Facebook Jail is a term that is widely used when the site blocks your ability to post or comment on the content already posted. This block can be temporary and can also be permanent. It can lead to account termination as well.

There are several reasons for which the site blocks pages or profiles to post the content. If you are getting too many likes too fast, posting inappropriate content or breaking any rule then remember that you are doomed. Under such circumstances, the user comes to know via email that the features have been disabled.

With Facebook Jail you can be blocked for:

* A few hours
* 3 Days
* 6 Days
* A week
* It can be permanent as well.

It all depends upon the type of offense that has been committed. Getting out of the Facebook jail is in your own hands. You can avoid the situation fully if you read this article till the end.

## Top 10 Ways to Avoid Facebook Jail

Below are the top ways that can be applied to make sure that the best outcome is generated in this regard.

![how to get out of facebook jail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-jail-1.jpg)

#### 1. Don’t Spam Even if Your Post is Legit

It is important to understand that no site likes spamming. The same behavior is adopted by Facebook as the sheriff is always out to ensure that the site is safe for all. Even if your post is legit try to increase the time interval between posts.

If you post the same content over several groups or pages then you can land into issues. Facebook will block your account for future use. You might also end up being terminated permanently just in case the message was widely spread.

#### 2. Plagiarism is Your Enemy

It is a fact that plagiarism is your enemy. If you just post the link to the content and don’t spam it, it is just fine. If you are copying the entire content you will land into issues.

The same applies to the images that have been used in your posts. Certain images are on Google Images and have been marked as spam. Using such images will result in penalization and ultimate Facebook jail which will hamper your productivity.

It is advice from the content creators that work for Facebook that always use original content to avoid misadventure.

Here, I recommend Wondershare Filmora to create original yet interesting videos on Facebook effortlessly. With Filmora Template Mode, it is easier than ever to edit your Facebook videos because the AI-powered tool will edit the videos automatically.

#### 3. Avoid Being Anon and Tag Carefully

Don’t be anonymous with your friends as it can result in issues. If you are being anonymous for no reason and to top it all tagging your “Friends” then you can land in trouble. Real people are the best ones you should always use your real friend to tag into a post.

Honesty is the best policy and Facebook likes it as well. Tagging random people can get your account blocked permanently. It is one of the best ways on the topic of how to get out of Facebook jail with ease.

Add people to your group if you know them and only tag them with your real and personal profile. The element of trust is very important and will benefit you a lot in the long run.

#### 4. Use the Site properly

How do you know if you are in Facebook jail? The simple answer to this is the fact that you are not using the site properly. Get to know how the website works and how can you benefit from the features of the site.

Too much knowledge is dangerous and the same happens with the people as they start manipulating the algorithm of the site. Always remember that the people that are sitting in the management of Facebook are smarter than you are. You will not only get banned but if the offense is done repetitively then you might be kicked out permanently.

#### 5. One Facebook Account for One Person

It is important to note that for life you can have only one Facebook account. The algorithm has been defined in such a way that the links between the accounts are also explored by the bots. If Facebook gets to know the link between two of your accounts then you are done.

Some people get a ban as they create a profile for personal use and the business profile is also used for the same purpose. If this happens the Facebook will block you from posting from any of your accounts. In all such cases, the content is blocked and the person is Facebook jailed.

#### 6. Don’t Act Weird

Believe it or not but this can also lead to your account suspension. For instance, if you are sending friend requests to people you don't know then it is obvious that you will get jail for it i.e. the one on Facebook. Don’t send multiple requests at the same time as it can also make the site feel that you are a spammer.

The other issue is that people use private messaging to promote their business. It should never be done as it can lead to issues and troubles. Even don’t ever advertise your business on the pages of other businesses.

![facebook jail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/out-of-facebook-jail.jpg)

#### 7. Beware of Dirty Play

Beware of the people that can get your page marked as spam. This is done on a large scale just to harm your reputation. The first thing that you would notice is a constant spamming of your posts in the form of trolls.

In case any such behavior is observed then such accounts must be banned from your page. Also, report the individual accounts by marking them as spam. Perform this action ASAP so that you remain out of trouble.

Last but not least; reach out to customer support. Once they get to know this you are in the safe zone. Many links can be used to get the information as profiles and the pages get attacked all day every day.

#### 8. Comment and Like but be Cautious

It is another important factor that should be considered to avoid Facebook Timeout. Liking and commenting on pages at a fast pace is the main reason. If this is the case the Facebook algorithm will consider you like a spam bot.

Such bots are developed to mimic human behavior. You just need to control your pace and don’t have to be too quick as it can get you into the Facebook jail for no reason. Traffic information is an asset to Facebook and this is done just to maintain the balance.

#### 9. Avoid Information Overload

The information that you share on your profile or page must be very much balanced. It is a simple phenomenon and the business models should be developed in the same manner. Sharing every bit of detail is neither recommended nor does Facebook like it.

If you are running a business page then it is important that you only post 5 – 6 times a day. Telling customers everything on Facebook is not likable and at times the customers also get frustrated by getting constant notifications. Such users won't hesitate to mark your page as spam and get you into trouble.

#### 10. Be as Accessible as Possible

Your consumers must contact you easily. Providing adequate info on your page is the only way to do so. It is something that Facebook likes and the info presented should be permanent.

Permanent info shows that you are here to stay and are the owner of a legit business. The information section of your page should reflect instantly who you are and what the page is about. This will also help you in generating leads and get more new users regularly.

## How to Find Out If You Are in Facebook Jail?

![what is facebook jail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-jail-2.jpg)

It is too simple and there is no need for any sort of software or installation for this. If you have screwed something up as soon as you log in you will get to know. If you are in a current Facebook session and get jailed you will not be able to like the next post you see.

As compared to the past the Facebook policies have become stern with time. Getting jailed means that you have violated the terms and conditions of the website usage. In such a situation, you just need to read through this guide.

Facebook jail is easy to break but only if you employ the right strategy. Take a look at your profile to know the reason and the pages you manage. If everything fails then it is advised to turn to the Facebook community for help and contact their support to find a way out.

## Why Are You in Facebook Jail?

There are several reasons for which you have been Facebook jailed. Some most important reasons are mentioned as under:

* If you have been posting nude and provocative content then you will get banned. Facebook has a very stern policy against such content.
* If you hate a group then keep it to yourself. There must not be any hate speech, threats, or attacks on any person or group on Facebook.
* Spamming is like getting your Facebook account closed with your hand. Don't do it or else you will regret it.
* Never think that you have a large fan following and you can manipulate the Facebook algorithm. Regardless of the fan base, you will get banned instantly.
* Real you are liked by Facebook. Imposter you are spam and therefore will ultimately get blocked for posting a fake update and plagiarized content.
* There can be any term or condition that has been violated by the subscriber that can lead to the issue.

![what is facebook jail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-jail-3.jpg)

Also, you must take care of the following points so that you never get into trouble or in Facebook Time out Mode:

**Read the Terms of Service**

It is important to read the [terms of service of Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php). Before you start a page on Facebook just read through the Facebook terms of service so that you never get into trouble. Reading and understanding are important instead of thinking that getting out of Facebook jail-free card will do the trick.

**Suspicious Payments**

Register your real credit card for Facebook ads. It should be yours and must be in your possession all the time. Facebook does not like fraud and doing it with the site will get you banned instantly. Also, any payments that have been made through such cards will be reversed and you will face the penalty.

No site likes stolen cards to be registered with them and Facebook has all the right to put you in jail if this happens.

## How Long Facebook Jail Does Last?

It is never advised to breach the rules of the website. It is something that is unacceptable and you will get into trouble sooner rather than later. Don't ever go for the like services no manner how much they have spoken highly of their services.

Getting fake likes is one of the things that could get you into trouble.

First thing first your account cannot get blocked for more than 21 days. If you are still unable to post after the said period then you have been executed. The Facebook block can be classified into 3 categories:

* **The Highest Level**

It is the complete suspension of the account. It means that you are gone and done. There is no way to get the account back and the content as well.

In such a case, if anyone visits your page he will either be redirected to the main page or there would be a 404 error.

* **The Middle Level**

In such a case, certain features of your account are permanently suspended. Your account is not blocked but the features are forever disabled. For instance, you can post content to your timeline but cannot like the content on a friend's timeline.

There are other features that are also suspended in such cases. It includes Facebook ads, the marketplace, and group access. Depending upon the circumstances you might also not be able to access Facebook-based subscriptions as well.

* **The Lowest Level**

This level expires once the timeline mentioned by Facebook passes. The same features will be disabled which is done in the middle level but the ban is temporary. There is also a feature that allows you to file an appeal and this ban could get lifted even before the maturity date.

## How to Come out of Facebook Jail if You Get Blocked?

When it comes to the lowest level there is pretty much what can be done. You can file an appeal for a Facebook review. Once it is done you will get an email about the outcome of your appeal.

Either the website will accept or reject it. There have been many cases where people have won the appeals and the site has restored their functionality.

As for the other two levels which are higher there is nothing that you could do. The simple thing is to not waste your energy and get going with a new page or even an account. In a nutshell, you can get out of the lowest level of penalty but for the other two levels, the chances are slim to none.

Getting out of the Facebook jail is not a play and therefore should not be taken easily. The best part is that there is a bit of control which you can enjoy when it comes to this subject. It means that on the lowest level you can enjoy limited control in the form of appeal.

**Facebook Jail Meme**

Facebook jail meme can be regarded as a type of protest against the block by the website. Though these are just memes there are pages on Facebook those post such pictures. These pages just make it a fun-filled activity and the memes can also be downloaded and saved for future use.

Other than the Facebook pages many websites offer such content. You can download the images and post them to your Facebook account. This is a light fun-filled activity and you will enjoy it a lot.

Below are some websites that can be used to download such memes:

* [ballmemes.com](https://ballmemes.com/t/facebook-jail-meme)
* [memeshappen.com](https://memeshappen.com/)
* [isitfunnyoroffensive.com](https://isitfunnyoroffensive.com)

And here are the websites that you can generate your own funny Facebook jail memes:

* [imgflip.com](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/25149768/Facebook-jail)

## Conclusion

Facebook jail is something you never want to get into. The only way out of this is to avoid it. Prevention is better than cure and just refraining from the activities Facebook doesn’t like is the only way to elude the problem completely.

This problem is only faced if you are not abiding by the terms and conditions of the website.
