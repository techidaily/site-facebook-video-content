**Step 2:** Choose 'live video' from that list of options. This will open a new page with two choices. You can choose to 'Go Live.' Alternatively, you can also choose to 'Create live video events.' Creating a live event gives your audience a chance to engage with you by responding to the event. Facebook also sends a reminder about the event before the schedule.
