## Part 4: How to Make My Posted Videos Show up on Chrome?

It is important to pay attention to **why can't I see my uploaded videos on Facebook** via Chrome? The article presents four effortless methods to help with **FB videos not showing up.**

### Solution 1: Altering the Video Format

**Step 1:** Launch Wondershare UniConverter from your system and click on "Converter" from the left panel. Add the targeted video file by clicking on "Add Files."

**Step 1:** Open the browser and click on three dots from the top left corner of the interface. Click on "Settings" from there. Navigate to "Privacy and Security" afterward.

**Step 2:** Tap on "Clear Browsing Data" and set the time range. You can choose to clear the data from all times, since a week or an hour before. Tick mark on all options to get rid of cache.
