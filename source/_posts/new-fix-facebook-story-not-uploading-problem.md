**Step 1:** In this first step, hold your Android device and click on "Settings." Choose "Apps" from the diverse menu options. After that, tap on "Manage Apps."

**Step 2:** Search for "Facebook" and open it. Navigate to the "Storage" from there. The system shows the app's total size, user data, and cache.
